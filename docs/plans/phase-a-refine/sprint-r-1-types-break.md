# Sprint r-1 — sc-agent-types break (D1, D6, D7 types, D10-break, D11 types)

## Outcome

One deliberate pre-1.0 break of `sc-agent-types`, carrying **every** types
change the phase needs, so no later sprint reopens the crate (r-5 Branch B is
additive by construction). After r-1 the backend set and error enum are open,
backend facts are static data on a descriptor, errors are explicit variants
with no string-prefix parsing, answers are typed, `sc-agent-types` links no
`sc-observability*`, and module seams are cargo features. All call sites and
tests in the workspace are updated in this sprint, including both `main.rs`
files and the `sc-treesitter` modules that construct `JevError` variants
(`grammar.rs`, `query.rs`, `git_io.rs`, `main.rs`): every struct-like
variant gets a constructor, so those files change from literals to
constructor calls and nothing else. `ScAgentErrorResponse::from_jev_error`
keeps its name. r-1 also removes every remaining `#[allow]` under `crates/`.

**Unfreezes the a-1 contract once** (sprint-a-1 deliverable 8, REQ-SAG-0103,
`docs/sc-agent-types/architecture.md`). The doc and REQ-SAG-0103 are amended
in this sprint to say the contract is re-frozen at r-1 merge.

## Deliverables

### D0 — first step: `sc-boundary` dev-edge and self-edge spike (RBQA-F101)

r-1 writes the first self-referencing dev-dependency of the phase
(`sc-agent-types`, D10.11), so it settles how `sc-boundary` treats dev edges
before it writes one. On a throwaway branch, run `sc-lint lint sc-boundary`
on three cases and record the rule ids that fire:

1. a dev-only edge between two different workspace crates (no normal edge);
2. a self edge, `<crate> = { path = ".", features = ["test-util"] }`;
3. an `allowed_dependencies` / `allowed_dependents` entry with no normal edge
   behind it (does `SCB-DEPENDENCY-004` call it stale?).

The same run loads a scratch manifest with `facade = ""` and the full
`[references]`, `[testing]`, `[enforcement]`, `[status]` blocks, to confirm
the sc-lint 0.8 schema accepts an empty facade (RBQA-F104). The result is
recorded in a "Dev-dependency and self edges" paragraph of
`boundaries/README.md` in r-1's PR, so it exists before wave 2 starts. The
recorded outcome decides every later self edge:

- **Dev edges ignored** (expected; the README says dev-dependencies are
  excluded): self dev-dependencies need no manifest entry. r-3b's
  `workspace-tests` manifests take the "ignored" branch (plan.md "New
  boundary manifests").
- **Dev edges counted, self entries accepted:** every manifest of a crate
  with a self dev-dependency lists the crate in its own
  `allowed_dependencies` and `allowed_dependents`, in the sprint that adds
  the self edge (r-1 `sc-agent-types`; r-2 `sc-jev-check`; r-3
  `sc-agent-http`; r-2b `sc-jev`, `sc-jev-backends`; r-3b `sc-ai`).
  `workspace-tests` takes the "counted" branch.
- **Dev edges counted, self edge ignored:** cross-crate dev edges need
  manifest entries (the `workspace-tests` "counted" branch), but a self
  dev-dependency is neither flagged nor listed, so no self entry is
  written and no `[[test]] required-features` rework is needed.
- **Dev edges counted, self edge flagged and self entry rejected:** no
  crate gets a self dev-dependency. Each integration target that needs a hook is declared
  `[[test]] name = "<t>" required-features = ["test-util"]`, and every
  validation line for it passes `--features test-util` (a plain
  `cargo test` then skips it instead of failing to compile). The
  `test_util_off` gate is unchanged, because a command-line feature is not a
  dependency edge. The PR states this branch and every later sprint doc
  line it changes, including the "Correction" sentence of the ADR-SAG-0022
  r-2 amendment (`docs/architecture.md`), which says `sc-jev-check`'s
  integration targets enable `test-util` through a self-referencing
  dev-dependency; in this branch r-2 rewords it to "through
  `[[test]] required-features = ["test-util"]` and `--features test-util`".

### D1 — open backend set, static facts (REQ-SAG-0105, ADR-SAG-0009 r-1 amendment)

1. `ids.rs`: `BackendDescriptor` with **private** fields and `const fn`
   accessors: `id() -> BackendId`, `name() -> &'static str`,
   `aliases() -> &'static [&'static str]`, `key_id() -> Option<BackendKeyId>`,
   `family() -> BackendFamily`, `requires_llm_context() -> bool`,
   `supports_session_ask() -> bool`, `request_limit_bytes() -> u64`.
   `pub static BACKENDS: &[BackendDescriptor]` (rows `jev`, `haiku`,
   `openai_luna`; the two existing 96 000 limits move into the rows).
   `BackendId::descriptor() -> &'static BackendDescriptor`; `as_str`,
   `key_id`, `family`, `Display`, `FromStr` all read it. The one exhaustive
   `match` over `BackendId` is inside `ids.rs` (descriptor lookup).
2. `#[non_exhaustive]` on `BackendId`, `BackendKeyId`,
   `#[non_exhaustive] enum BackendFamily { TypeSafeJev, Llm, Local }`.
3. `judge.rs`: `BackendCapabilities` with private fields,
   `BackendCapabilities::from_descriptor(&BackendDescriptor)` and accessors.
   `JudgeBackend::capabilities(&self) -> BackendCapabilities` is a **provided**
   method returning `self.id().descriptor()`'s facts; implementors do not
   restate `family` or limits. Facts needed before any backend exists
   (`prepare`, dry-run, session-ask eligibility) are read from the descriptor.
4. `JudgeBackend` is **intentionally open** (not sealed): external crates may
   implement it; every method added after r-1 has a default body (rustdoc +
   ADR-SAG-0009/0027). `# Blocking` rustdoc section: calls block; async hosts
   use `spawn_blocking` (D10).
5. `BackendSet`: non-empty, duplicate-free `Vec<BackendId>` newtype with
   `TryFrom<Vec<BackendId>>` (`CONFIG_INVALID` on empty/duplicate) and
   `FromStr` for comma lists.
6. **Backend factory table (test-and-review convention).** The production
   factory in `sc-jev-check::registry` is data, not a `match`:
   `static FACTORIES: &[(BackendId, fn(ResolvedApiKey) -> Arc<dyn JudgeBackend>)]`,
   one row per built-in backend, each row calling that backend's
   `with_default_transport`. The a-10 production entry
   `registry::registry_for_repo` (renamed `BackendRegistry::from_env` by r-2)
   looks the id up in the table; an id with no row is `RegistryInvalid`
   (`CONFIG_INVALID`). `FACTORIES` stays private:
   `test_every_backend_has_factory` is a `--lib` unit test
   (`registry::tests::test_every_backend_has_factory`) that iterates
   `BACKENDS` and fails for a descriptor with no row, a row with no
   descriptor, or a `BackendId` that appears in two rows.
   Outside `ids.rs` (descriptor lookup) and this table, code branches on
   **descriptor facts** (`family()`, `requires_llm_context()`,
   `supports_session_ask()`, `request_limit_bytes()`), never on id equality
   or a `match` on `BackendId`; r-1 converts the one existing equality
   (`crates/sc-ai/src/command.rs` `outcome.backend == BackendId::Jev` →
   `family() == BackendFamily::TypeSafeJev`). No clippy lint enforces this
   (`clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm` is silent when every variant is listed
   plus the required `_` arm, and a crate-wide deny would also hit
   `serde_json::Value` matches), so the rule is the test plus review, stated
   in ADR-SAG-0009/0027 and REQ-SAG-0105. Validation adds a cheap
   tripwire for the known pattern:
   `! rg -n 'BackendId::[A-Za-z]+ *==|== *BackendId::' crates/ --glob '!crates/sc-agent-types/src/ids.rs' --glob '!**/tests/**'`.
   `BackendRegistry::register(Arc<dyn JudgeBackend>)` (r-2) installs a double
   or scripted backend **for an existing id**; it cannot introduce a new id
   (the id set is the closed `#[non_exhaustive]` enum).

   **Adding a built-in backend** (checklist, ADR-SAG-0027): (1) minor
   `sc-agent-types` release: `BackendId` variant, `BACKENDS` row (facts,
   aliases, limit), `BackendKeyId` variant if it has a new key; (2) the
   backend type in its crate, with `with_default_transport`; (3) one
   `FACTORIES` row; (4) `test_every_backend_has_factory` and
   `test_backend_catalog_roundtrip` pass unchanged. No consumer signature
   changes.
7. Backend constructors become infallible (validation is only
   `ResolvedApiKey::try_new`): `JevClient::new`, `AnthropicHaikuBackend::new`,
   `OpenAiLunaBackend::new` return `Self`. Each also gets
   `with_default_transport(key: ResolvedApiKey) -> Self`; the registry factory
   calls only these, so r-3 can change the transport type without touching
   `sc-jev-check`. Each backend's `validate_for_send` reads
   `self.id().descriptor().request_limit_bytes()` (one constant per backend).
8. **Serde spelling fix** (a-10 follow-up). `OpenAiLuna` → `openai_luna`,
   `BackendKeyId::OpenAi` → `openai`, read alias `open_ai_luna` / `open_ai`
   for config and caller-request input (bead
   `agt-backend-serde-alias-removal`). One alias source: `BackendId`
   implements `Deserialize` through `FromStr`, which reads the descriptor's
   `name()` and `aliases()`; there is no `#[serde(alias)]`. `Serialize`
   writes `name()`. `test_backend_serde_documented_spelling` and
   `test_backend_serde_reads_old_alias` (target `ids`).

### D6 — error taxonomy (REQ-SAG-0106, REQ-SAG-0101 amendment, ADR-SAG-0027)

1. `#[non_exhaustive]` on `JevError`, and `#[non_exhaustive]` on each
   struct-like variant, so downstream crates construct only through
   constructors. **Every struct-like variant has a public constructor**
   (snake-case of the variant: `extraction_failed(detail)`,
   `input_invalid(..)`, `input_missing(path)`,
   `language_unavailable(producer, language)`,
   `query_not_found(producer, query)`, `query_invalid(producer, detail)`,
   `producer_error(producer: impl Into<String>, code: ErrorCode, message: impl Into<String>)`,
   `network(kind, detail)`, and
   the existing `operational_io` / `operational_config` / `io_failed` thin
   constructors), so every cross-crate literal in `sc-treesitter`
   (`grammar.rs`, `query.rs`, `git_io.rs`, `main.rs`), `sc-ai/src/main.rs`
   and the other crates becomes a call. Unit variants stay unit variants.
   Code table (each new variant replaces the named Phase A
   constructor; `code()` ids unchanged):

   | Variant | Replaces | `code()` |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `CredentialStoreInvalid { what, cause, recovery }` | `credential_store_invalid` | `CONFIG_INVALID` |
   | `RegistryInvalid { detail, recovery }` | `registry_invalid` | `CONFIG_INVALID` |
   | `SessionStoreIo { op, kind: io::ErrorKind, recovery }` | `session_store_io` | `CONFIG_INVALID` |
   | `Operational { area: OperationalArea::Config, recovery }` | `operational_config` (kept as thin ctor) | `CONFIG_INVALID` |
   | `Operational { area: OperationalArea::Io, recovery }` | `operational_io` (kept as thin ctor) | `INPUT_INVALID` |
   | `SessionDocumentInvalid { detail, recovery }` | `session_document_invalid` | `INPUT_INVALID` |
   | `EncodeFailed { what, cause }` | `encode_failed` | `INPUT_INVALID` |
   | `IoFailed { what, kind }` | `io_failed` | `INPUT_INVALID` |
   | `LanguageUnavailable { producer, language }` | sc-treesitter-named variant | `LANGUAGE_UNAVAILABLE` |
   | `QueryInvalid { producer, detail }`, `QueryNotFound { producer, query }` | sc-treesitter-named variants | `QUERY_INVALID`, `QUERY_NOT_FOUND` |
   | `ProducerError { producer: String, code: ErrorCode, message: String }` | (new; producer stderr) | the carried `code` |
   | `NetworkError { kind: NetworkErrorKind, detail }` | `NetworkError { detail }` | `NETWORK_ERROR` |

   `OperationalArea` is `#[non_exhaustive] { Config, Io }`; its `code()`
   depends on the area, as the table states. Every `producer` field
   (`ProducerError`, `LanguageUnavailable`, `QueryInvalid`, `QueryNotFound`)
   is a `String`: it carries a runtime command name from `check.toml` (r-2
   D11.3) and is serialized as `details.producer`. REQ-SAG-0101 is amended from
   "one variant per id" to "every variant maps to exactly one id; an id may
   have several variants".
2. `ErrorCode`: `#[non_exhaustive]` enum with one variant per id in
   `errors.json`, `as_str() -> &'static str`, `Display`, `FromStr`, and
   `ErrorCode::ALL: &[ErrorCode]` (a hand-written `const` table; no
   `build.rs`). `JevError::code()` returns `ErrorCode`.
   `test_error_codes_match_errors_json` (target `errors`) asserts the set of
   `ErrorCode::ALL.as_str()` values equals the ids in
   `tests/fixtures/jev/README-contract/errors.json`. Completeness of `ALL`
   is a compile-time check: the unit test
   `error::tests::test_error_code_all_is_complete` holds an exhaustive
   in-crate `match` over `ErrorCode` with no wildcard arm (inside the crate
   `#[non_exhaustive]` does not force one), whose every arm asserts that
   variant is in `ALL`; a new variant fails to compile until it is matched.
   `test_every_variant_code_golden` (target `errors`) constructs each variant
   in the table **through its public constructor** (an integration target
   cannot use literals of a `#[non_exhaustive]` variant, so the test also
   proves every constructor exists) and asserts its `code()` and the first
   line of `fix_hint()` against
   `crates/sc-agent-types/tests/fixtures/error-codes.json`.
3. `NetworkErrorKind` (`#[non_exhaustive]`: `Busy`, `Timeout`, `Connect`,
   `Tls`, `Status`, `BodyTooLarge`, `Cancelled`). `retryable()` is true only
   for `NetworkError { kind: Busy | Timeout | Connect }`. Its one spelling is
   snake_case: `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (`#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]`),
   `Display` and `FromStr` all use `busy`, `timeout`, `connect`, `tls`,
   `status`, `body_too_large`, `cancelled`, so the r-2b D5 scripted-answers
   `"kind"` value parses through `FromStr`; an unknown kind is
   `INPUT_INVALID`. Pinned by `test_network_error_kind_spelling` (target
   `errors`: serde, `Display` and `FromStr` agree for every kind).
4. `fix_hint()` is the one renderer of recovery text: an exhaustive `match`
   inside the crate; `recovery` fields are data it formats. Delete the four
   `*_DETAIL_PREFIX` constants and the `strip_prefix` chain.
5. `Error::source()`: `None` for every redacted-cause variant
   (`CredentialStoreInvalid`, `NetworkError`, `EncodeFailed`, `IoFailed`,
   `SessionStoreIo`); no variant carries a non-redacted source in A.1. Stated
   per variant class in ADR-SAG-0027.
6. `ProducerError { producer, code: ErrorCode, message }` and
   `from_error_response(producer, &ScAgentErrorResponse) -> JevError`: a
   known code (`ErrorCode::from_str` over `ErrorCode::ALL`) becomes
   `ProducerError` whose `code()` returns the carried code and whose
   `fix_hint()` is `"{producer}: {message}"`; an unknown code becomes
   `ExtractionFailed` naming the code. `test_from_error_response_round_trip`
   (target `errors`) round-trips every code. r-2 consumes it for
   command-producer stderr only.
7. **`ScAgentErrorResponse` field rule** (NFR-SAG-0001 amendment,
   ADR-SAG-0027). The constructor keeps its name,
   `ScAgentErrorResponse::from_jev_error(&JevError)`; no rename, so neither
   `main.rs` call changes. Serialized key order is fixed:
   `error`, `message`, `schema_version`, `retryable`, `details`.
   - `schema_version`: always `1` from `from_jev_error`. It versions this
     error shape only, independent of the stdout `Envelope.version`, and is
     bumped only by a breaking change to this shape.
   - `retryable`: present (`true`) only when `JevError::retryable()` is true;
     absent otherwise (never `false`).
   - `details`: present only for `ProducerError`, as `{"producer": <name>}`;
     absent for every other variant. `details` is a closed object.
   `Deserialize` (producer stderr): `deny_unknown_fields` on the response and
   on `details`; `schema_version` absent (a Phase A producer) or `1` is
   accepted; any other value, or an unknown key, fails to parse, so the
   `command` extractor falls back to `ExtractionFailed` (r-2 D11.3). Because
   readers deny unknown fields, adding any key, top-level or inside
   `details`, is a breaking change of this shape and bumps `schema_version`.
   **Consumer rule** (EXT-030, ADR-SAG-0027): an agent or CLI/MCP client may
   read `schema_version` from every stderr line; a value other than `1`
   means "unknown error shape", and the client falls back to the exit code
   and the raw line. A bump is announced in the changelog. This changes the
   stderr bytes of every error (one added `"schema_version":1` key):
   NFR-SAG-0001 and REQ-SAG-0701 are amended in this sprint and the bytes are
   pinned by
   `test_error_response_stderr_golden` (target `errors`), which serializes
   `INPUT_EMPTY`, `NETWORK_ERROR` (`Busy`) and a `ProducerError` and compares
   with `crates/sc-agent-types/tests/fixtures/error-stderr.jsonl`:
   `{"error":"INPUT_EMPTY","message":"…","schema_version":1}`,
   `{"error":"NETWORK_ERROR","message":"…","schema_version":1,"retryable":true}`,
   `{"error":"LANGUAGE_UNAVAILABLE","message":"…","schema_version":1,"details":{"producer":"sc-treesitter"}}`.

### D10-break — outcome and attestation shape

1. Remove `JudgeOutcome.probabilities`. `answers` becomes
   `BTreeMap<QuestionId, QuestionAnswer>`. `QuestionAnswer` has private
   fields `choice: ChoiceId`, optional `confidence: f64` and optional
   `probabilities: BTreeMap<ChoiceId, f64>`, a constructor
   `QuestionAnswer::new(choice, confidence: Option<f64>, probabilities) -> Result<Self, JevError>`
   and accessors. Every Jev answer carries `confidence` today (a-10
   `crates/sc-jev/src/check.rs` requires it); LLM backends leave it `None`.
   Serialized keys are `choice`, `confidence`, `probabilities` in that order,
   each optional key omitted when `None`. `ChoiceId` is a validated string
   newtype (non-empty, no control characters) in `ids`.
   **Finite-number rule:** `confidence` and every probability are finite and
   in `[0, 1]` (NaN, infinity, negative or > 1 is `RESPONSE_INVALID`);
   `Deserialize` goes through the same constructor (`#[serde(try_from)]`), so
   an invalid backend response never becomes a `QuestionAnswer`.
   `QuestionAnswer` derives `PartialEq` only (not `Eq`, because of `f64`).
   Its serde form is byte-identical to today's `answers` JSON for the three
   keys `choice`, `confidence`, `probabilities`: golden test
   `test_answers_serde_golden` (target `judge`) round-trips a real a-10 Jev
   answer object with `confidence` and an LLM answer without it. A
   per-answer key outside those three is not modelled; it survives only in
   `provider_meta` (CPR-203 option (a)).
   **Relation to `ChoiceAnswer`:** `QuestionAnswer` is a backend's *output*
   for one question; `ChoiceAnswer { question_id, choice }` is an *input*
   (prior state inside the canonical payload, part of `prompt_sha256`
   bytes). They are deliberately separate types; `ChoiceAnswer` is untouched
   except `question_id: QuestionId` and `choice: ChoiceId` with byte-identical
   serde. `QuestionAnswer::to_choice_answer(&QuestionId)` is the one
   conversion (used when a session `ask` feeds prior answers back).
   `provider_meta` stays `Option<Value>` (D10 defers typed `JudgeMeta`).
2. `JudgeOutcome` gets private fields,
   `JudgeOutcome::new(backend, request: &JudgeRequest, answers) -> Result<Self, JevError>`,
   `with_provider_meta`, `with_input_sha256`, accessors. The question set
   comes from `PayloadBundle::question_choices() -> &BTreeMap<QuestionId, BTreeSet<ChoiceId>>`,
   computed once by `PayloadBundle::encode` from the canonical payload's
   questions; every bundle is built through `encode` (the crate-private byte
   path, if kept, parses its bytes into `CanonicalJudgePayload` first and is
   `INPUT_INVALID` otherwise), so no bundle lacks the map.
   `PayloadBundle::question_ids()` returns its keys. `new` checks that the
   answer key set equals `question_ids()`, that each answer's `choice`, and
   each key of its `probabilities`, is one of that question's choices
   (RBP minor 1); any failure is `RESPONSE_INVALID`. So no outcome exists
   whose answers do not match the questions and choices asked. It is not
   `#[non_exhaustive]`: backend crates construct it.
3. `JudgeOutcome.input_sha256: Option<Sha256Digest>` — `None` means "this
   backend does not attest". r-1 adds the field only; every backend returns
   `None` until r-2b, the single sprint that implements backend-side hashing.
4. `#[non_exhaustive] enum MultiBackendMode { #[default] Independent, ChainContext }`.
5. `#[non_exhaustive] enum Attestation { Matched, Mismatched { reported: Sha256Digest }, Unattested, Failed, NotSent }`
   and `BackendAttestation` (private `backend`, `attestation`; accessors).
   `EqualInputRecord` gets private fields, a constructor, and
   `{ prompt_sha256, mode, backends: Vec<BackendAttestation>, leak, producer }`.
   `equal` is **derived, not stored**: `EqualInputRecord::equal()` returns
   true iff every entry is `Matched`; the hand-written `Serialize` writes
   `equal` from that method (so the JSON key stays), and `Deserialize`
   rejects a document whose `equal` differs from the recomputed value
   (`SESSION_DOCUMENT_INVALID` when read from a session file). `commands:
   Vec<String>` is deleted (the typed `backends` list replaces it). Dry-run
   records `NotSent` per selected backend and `equal = false`. In r-1 the
   engine records `Unattested` for every backend (true today, not a claim).
6. `JudgeRequest` holds `Arc<PayloadBundle>` (no clone per backend) and
   `cancel: CancelToken`. Backends do not re-validate inside `judge`; the
   engine calls `validate_for_send` once per send.
7. `CancelToken` (`Arc<AtomicBool>`, `cancel()`, `is_cancelled()`,
   `Default` = never cancelled) in `sc-agent-types::cancel`, std-only and
   **always on** (not behind `judge`), so `sc-agent-http` needs only the
   `secret` feature.
8. `PayloadBundle::encode(&CanonicalJudgePayload) -> Result<PayloadBundle, JevError>`
   replaces the public `payload_bundle_from_value` (made `pub(crate)` or
   deleted). `CanonicalJudgePayload` and `Question` get private fields with
   constructors and accessors so a D9 Branch B field is additive.
9. Newtypes: `QuestionId`, `BlobSha` (40/64-hex, reusing the a-10
   validator), `RepoRelativePath` (`TryFrom<&str>`, `FromStr`,
   `Deserialize`; the validator for repo-relative paths (adopted by sc-agent-types, the shared git helper and sc-treesitter in r-1; `InputSpec`/`CheckSpec` paths follow in r-2): no `..`, no
   absolute, no `\`, NUL or `:`), `Operation` enum (`Judge`, `Ask`) for
   `LogEvent.operation`. `SubjectsBuilder::push_subject`, `Subject.path`
   and `Question.id` use them; the two-bool argument of
   `equal_input::record` becomes a struct.
10. `ResolvedApiKey` stores `Arc<str>`; the unchecked `ResolvedApiKey::new`
    is deleted in every build, including under `cfg(test)` and the
    `sc-agent-types/test-util` feature; `try_new` is the only constructor and
    test keys use it (ADR-SAG-0020 r-1 amendment, which supersedes the
    ADR-SAG-0029 (a) sentence "The unchecked `ResolvedApiKey::new` exists only
    under `cfg(test)` or the `sc-agent-types/test-util` feature, for test
    doubles").
11. One `JudgeBackend` test double home (ARCHC-010), behind the existing
    non-default `test-util` feature (plan "Test seams"):
    `test_util::MockJudgeBackend`. **Contract:**
    - `new(id, answers: BTreeMap<QuestionId, QuestionAnswer>)`; the outcome
      is built at `judge` time with `JudgeOutcome::new` against the request
      it received;
    - records every `JudgeRequest` it receives (`requests() -> Vec<JudgeRequest>`,
      interior `Mutex`, so a test that keeps an `Arc<MockJudgeBackend>` and
      registers a clone reads its own log) and counts `validate_for_send`
      calls (`validations() -> usize`);
    - `with_provider_meta(Value)` sets the outcome's `provider_meta` (Jev
      response samples);
    - reports `input_sha256 = Some(request.payload().sha256())`, the digest
      of the bundle it received; `with_reported_digest(Sha256Digest)` reports
      that digest instead (r-2b's mismatch tests);
    - `with_failure(JevError)` makes `judge` return the error after
      `validate_for_send` passed (a sent-and-failed backend);
      `refusing(JevError)` makes `validate_for_send` return it, so nothing is
      sent (ADR-SAG-0004 refusal; r-2b's `NotSent` / `Failed` attestation
      tests need both);
    - LLM context (ADR-SAG-0022, "An LLM backend id still requires
      `JudgeRequest.llm` before it returns"; CPR-302): when
      `self.id().descriptor().requires_llm_context()` is true and the request
      carries no LLM context, `validate_for_send` (still counted by
      `validations()`) and `judge` return `INPUT_INVALID` and record no
      request. `test_mock_judge_backend_contract` covers it; it replaces the
      a-10 unit test
      `registry::scripted::tests::scripted_judge_records_requests_and_counts_validations`,
      which pins this rule for `ScriptedJudge` today and goes with it.

    `test_mock_judge_backend_contract` (target `mock`) covers each item.
    The engine ignores `input_sha256` until r-2b (records `Unattested`).
    **`ScriptedJudge` and `RequestLog` are deleted** (CPR-205):
    `sc-jev-check`'s `registry::ScriptedJudge` and `registry::RequestLog`
    (public under `test-util` since a-10) duplicate the mock, so their
    callers (`crates/sc-ai/tests/cli.rs`, the local copy in
    `crates/sc-jev-check/tests/sessions_exact.rs`) move to
    `MockJudgeBackend`, and `register_scripted_backends(ids, answers)` keeps
    its signature and its string-shorthand normalisation but builds
    `MockJudgeBackend`s. This is the ADR-SAG-0022 r-1 amendment, which
    supersedes the ADR-SAG-0029 (b) sentence "`sc-jev-check` feature
    `test-util` makes `registry::ScriptedJudge`, `registry::RequestLog`, and
    `registry::register_scripted_backends` public" (only the last stays).
    Because the library code of `register_scripted_backends` now names
    `sc_agent_types::test_util`, r-1 changes the one `[features]` line of
    `crates/sc-jev-check/Cargo.toml` to
    `test-util = ["sc-agent-types/test-util"]`, so the pytest wheel's
    `sc-jev-py/test-util` → `sc-jev-check/test-util` build compiles (r-2 owns
    the rest of that file). `sc-agent-types`' own integration targets that
    need a non-default feature declare it with `[[test]] required-features`
    (`mock`: `test-util`; `git`: `git`) and their validation lines pass
    `--features` (D0 outcome 4: no self dev-dependency); nothing in `tests/`
    relies on `cfg(test)`.

### `#[non_exhaustive]` triage (RBP-F104)

Rule: a type another crate constructs gets private fields and a constructor,
not `#[non_exhaustive]`; a type only this crate constructs and others match or
read may be `#[non_exhaustive]`.

| Type | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| `BackendId`, `BackendKeyId`, `BackendFamily`, `JevError`, `NetworkErrorKind`, `OperationalArea`, `MultiBackendMode`, `Attestation`, `Operation` | `#[non_exhaustive]` enum |
| `BackendDescriptor`, `BackendCapabilities`, `BackendAttestation`, `EqualInputRecord`, `JudgeOutcome`, `QuestionAnswer`, `CanonicalJudgePayload`, `Question`, `PayloadBundle`, `Span`, `Subject`, `SubjectsDocument`, `GitBlob` | private fields + constructor/builder + accessors |
| `ChoiceId`, `QuestionId`, `BlobSha`, `RepoRelativePath` | validated newtype (private inner value, `TryFrom`/`FromStr`, `Deserialize` through the validator) |
| `ErrorCode` | `#[non_exhaustive]` enum with `as_str()` |
| `ScAgentErrorResponse` | private fields (a-10) + `from_jev_error` (name kept) + `Deserialize` |
| `LogEvent`, `JudgeRequest` | private fields + constructor |

### D7 — types scope and module seams (REQ-SAG-0107, REQ-SAG-0108, ADR-SAG-0016 r-1 amendment, ADR-SAG-0027)

1. `observability::v2::LogRejected { reason }` (`Display`, `Error`) replaces
   the re-exported `EventError`; `SessionLog::emit` returns
   `Result<(), LogRejected>`; drop `sc-observability-types` from
   `crates/sc-agent-types/Cargo.toml`, from
   `boundaries/sc-agent-types/agent-types.toml` `allowed_dependencies`, and
   the root `[workspace.dependencies]` line (r-1 removes the only user, so it
   removes the root entry in the same commit; r-4 deletes the `sc-lint.toml`
   record and keeps `sc-observability-types` off the ADR-SAG-0023 list).
   `SessionLog` is an open port (stated in rustdoc; RBP-F014).
   REQ-SAG-0120/0121 are amended (root and crate requirements): the port
   no longer depends on `sc-observability-types`; the noop and test-util
   doubles stay (their tests: target `obs`, incl. `test_log_rejected_display`
   moved there from `errors`).
2. Cargo features: `default = ["judge", "secret", "obs"]`; `git` and
   `test-util` are non-default. `judge` gates `judge` and `payload`;
   `secret` gates `secret`; `obs` gates `observability`; `git` gates `git`;
   `test-util` (requires `judge`) gates `test_util`. Always on: `error`,
   `envelope`, `ids`, `schema`, `cancel`. Dependencies used only by a gated
   module become optional deps of that feature. **Type homes:**

   | Module (feature) | Types | Extra deps |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `error` (core) | `JevError`, `ErrorCode`, `NetworkErrorKind`, `OperationalArea` | `thiserror` |
   | `envelope` (core) | `ScAgentErrorResponse` | `serde`, `serde_json` |
   | `ids` (core) | `BackendId`, `BackendKeyId`, `BackendFamily`, `BackendDescriptor`, `BACKENDS`, `BackendSet`, `SessionId`, `Rev`, `RepoRoot`, `RepoRelativePath`, `BlobSha`, `Sha256Digest` (incl. `Sha256Digest::of`), `QuestionId`, `ChoiceId`, `Operation` | `uuid` (`SessionId`), `sha2` (`Sha256Digest::of`) |
   | `schema` (core) | `schema::subjects::*`, `SubjectsBuilder` | — |
   | `cancel` (core) | `CancelToken` | — (std) |
   | `judge` / `payload` (`judge`) | `JudgeBackend`, `JudgeRequest`, `JudgeOutcome`, `QuestionAnswer`, `BackendCapabilities`, `MultiBackendMode`, `Attestation`, `BackendAttestation`, `EqualInputRecord`; `PayloadBundle`, `CanonicalJudgePayload`, `Question`, `ChoiceAnswer` | — (uses core `Sha256Digest::of`) |
   | `secret` (`secret`) | `ResolvedApiKey` | — |
   | `observability::v2` (`obs`) | `SessionLog`, `SharedSessionLog`, `LogEvent`, `LogRejected` | — |
   | `git` (`git`) | `discover_toplevel`, `read_at_rev`, `GitBlob` | — (std) |
   | `test_util` (`test-util`) | `MockJudgeBackend` | — |

   `sha2` is a core dependency (CPR-M202): `Sha256Digest::of` is in core
   `ids`, and the `sc-treesitter` library (`default-features = false`) calls
   it for `producer.query_sha256` (a-10 `extract.rs`), so it cannot sit
   behind `judge`. `secret` and `judge` are independent (neither enables the
   other); `git` needs only core. `cargo hack check -p sc-agent-types --feature-powerset
   --no-dev-deps` proves every combination builds (r-1 validation; r-4 adds
   it to CI). `cargo tree -p sc-agent-types --no-default-features -e normal`
   is pinned by `test_no_default_features_dep_set` (target `features`, runs
   the command and compares to a committed list, which includes `sha2`). `sc-treesitter` switches to
   `default-features = false` in r-3c; `sc-jev-check` enables `git` in r-2.
3. `schema::subjects` (moved from `subjects.rs`): `SubjectsDocument`,
   `Subject`, `Span`, `SubjectsProducer`, `SubjectsSource`, `SUBJECTS_SCHEMA_V1`.
   **`SubjectsDocument` is the one validated type** (there is no separate
   `ValidatedSubjects`): private fields, accessors, and construction only
   through `SubjectsBuilder::build` or `TryFrom<RawSubjectsDocument>`;
   `Deserialize` is `#[serde(try_from = "RawSubjectsDocument")]`, where the
   private `RawSubjectsDocument` mirrors the wire form and `try_from` runs
   `validate`. A `SubjectsDocument` value is therefore always valid.
   `SubjectsBuilder` (`new(source, producer)`,
   `push_subject(path: RepoRelativePath, span, text, kind)`, `build()`)
   assigns ids with the algorithm now in `sc-treesitter/src/render.rs`. The
   copies in `render.rs` and `sc-jev-check/src/extract/subjects.rs` are
   deleted. Crate-root re-exports of moved items are removed (one path each).
4. `InputSpec` leaves `sc-agent-types`: r-1 moves the type unchanged to
   `sc-jev-check::config::InputSpec` (its only consumer); r-2 adds
   `Command.path`.
5. `git` module (RBQA-F006 helper, non-default `git` feature):
   `discover_toplevel(start: &Path) -> Result<Option<RepoRoot>, JevError>` and
   `read_at_rev(root: &RepoRoot, rev: &Rev, path: &RepoRelativePath, max_bytes: u64) -> Result<GitBlob, JevError>`,
   where `GitBlob` has private `sha: BlobSha` and `bytes: Vec<u8>` with
   accessors and `into_bytes()`.
   Rules: argv only; `--no-pager`, `--end-of-options`, `--no-textconv`;
   `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`; `rev-parse --verify` to a blob sha, then
   `cat-file blob <sha>` (rejects trees); output read through a bounded reader
   (`max_bytes`, `INPUT_TOO_LARGE`); locale-independent classification
   (`LC_ALL=C`). Tests (target `git`, temp repo per test):
   `test_read_at_rev_matches_worktree_bytes`,
   `test_read_at_rev_rejects_option_injection` (`--output=FILE` as rev
   creates no file and returns `INPUT_INVALID`),
   `test_read_at_rev_rejects_tree`, `test_read_at_rev_bounded`,
   `test_discover_toplevel_from_subdirectory`. Callers migrate in r-2
   (`sc-jev-check`) and r-3c (`sc-treesitter`).
6. **Session document version 2.** `StoredSession` (in `sc-jev-check`) gets
   `version: 2`; a file with a missing or older version loads as
   `SessionDocumentInvalid` with recovery "re-run the check; Phase A session
   files cannot be resumed"; a **newer** version (> 2) also loads as
   `SessionDocumentInvalid`, with recovery "written by a newer sc-agent;
   upgrade or re-run the check" (`test_newer_session_version_is_invalid`). `test_phase_a_session_is_invalid` (target
   `session` in `sc-jev-check`) loads
   `crates/sc-jev-check/tests/fixtures/session-v1.json`.
7. ADR-SAG-0027 states: adding a backend follows the D1.6 checklist (a
   minor `sc-agent-types` change — variant + `BACKENDS` row — plus one
   `FACTORIES` row in `sc-jev-check`); "open" means additive-closed, not
   runtime-open; `register` installs doubles of existing ids only; module
   paths are the stable surface for a later re-export split (EXT-019); test
   seams are `test-util` features (plan "Test seams").

### Lint hygiene (CPR-103, RBQA-F003)

1. Convert every remaining `#[allow(..)]` under `crates/` to
   `#[expect(.., reason = "..")]`. At a-10 there are three:
   `crates/sc-agent-types/src/ids.rs` (`clippy::new_without_default` on
   `SessionId::new`), `crates/sc-jev/src/client/https.rs` and
   `crates/sc-jev-backends/src/transport.rs` (`clippy::disallowed_methods`,
   the two secret reads r-3 replaces). Gate in validation:
   `! rg -n '#!?\[allow\(' crates/`. This makes r-3's workspace
   `allow_attributes = "deny"` a no-op on arrival. It supersedes the
   ADR-SAG-0029 (a) sentence that the two sending transports "carry
   `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = ...)]`": from r-1 they carry
   `#[expect(..)]`, and r-3 deletes both files (ADR-SAG-0020 r-1 and r-3
   amendments).
2. Every existing crate keeps `[lints] workspace = true` (all eight have it
   at a-10) and has no per-crate `[lints]` table; r-1 adds none.
   `workspace-tests --test source_scans` (r-3b) asserts it for every crate.

## Implementation notes

QA-2 runtime evidence at `64c0e85`: sc-agent CI run 42382157921 (test ×3 OSes incl. the
`--features git,test-util` step, python ×3, rustdoc, feature matrix, coverage) and sc-publish
dry-run run 42382157967 — all green.

Added in the QA-1 fix round (PR 22). Validation logs: the developer run
(`scratchpad/validate.log`, 56/57 lines pass; the one failure was the
`ResolvedApiKey::new` comment gate, fixed by the parent in 22ef273) and
PR 22 CI at 22ef273: run 42379559440 (sc-agent CI) and run 42379559439
(sc-publish dry-run), both green. The fix-round head is re-validated with
the same list plus `cargo test -p sc-agent-types --features git,test-util`.

**D0 outcome: 4 — dev edges counted, self edge flagged and self entry
rejected** (`boundaries/README.md` "Dev-dependency and self edges"). A
path-only self dev-dependency is flagged by `SCB-MANIFEST-002`, which no
boundary manifest entry clears; a versioned one passes sc-lint but `cargo
package` then cannot resolve it from crates.io. So no crate gets a self
dev-dependency: integration targets that need a hook declare `[[test]]
required-features` and their validation lines pass `--features`. An
`exclude_paths_by_rule` record for `SCB-MANIFEST-002` in `sc-lint.toml`
would make outcome 2 possible; that is an r-4 / owner decision. Later lines
this changes: r-2 (`sc-jev-check`), r-3 (`sc-agent-http`), r-2b (`sc-jev`,
`sc-jev-backends`) and r-3b (`sc-ai`) use required-features instead of the
self dev-dependency their docs name (plan.md:132/444, sprint r-2:230,
r-3:172, r-3b:232/289); r-2 rewords the ADR-SAG-0022 r-2 "Correction"
sentence (`docs/architecture.md`) to "through `[[test]] required-features
= ["test-util"]` and `--features test-util`", and r-3b the ADR-SAG-0028
text; `workspace-tests` takes the "counted" branch and, because the schema
rejects `facade = ""`, uses `facade = "workspace_tests"`.

**ADR coverage.** D10-break items 3-5 ship shapes whose governing
amendments (ADR-SAG-0024 of 0014, ADR-SAG-0025 of 0008/0019) are Proposed
for r-2/r-2b. They are covered by Active "Amendment (Phase A.1, r-1 —
interim shapes)" subsections of ADR-SAG-0008, 0014 and 0019, each
superseded by 0024/0025 when those land. Their index A.1 markers were
added by this sprint at QA's request, an exception to the plan's "adds no
entry" rule; the ADR-SAG-0024/0025 "Amends" cells are left for r-2/r-2b to
reconcile. ADR-SAG-0025 is removed from `adrs` (Proposed); ADR-SAG-0014 and
0021 are added; ADR-SAG-0017 is not (r-1 changes no release channel) and
ADR-SAG-0018's kit files are untouched.

**Deviations from the text above**, with the requirement or ADR each touches:

| Deviation | Touches | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jev `max_request_bytes` removed from `jev.toml` and `JevClientConfig::try_new` (no longer an argument); `validate_for_send` reads `BackendId::Jev.descriptor().request_limit_bytes()` (96 000, unchanged) | REQ-SAG-0400, ADR-SAG-0009 r-1 | D1.7 "one constant per backend"; a second config copy would be a second fact table |
| `PayloadBundle::decode(&[u8])` is public | REQ-SAG-0103, ADR-SAG-0027 | session reload in `sc-jev-check` rebuilds stored bundles; it re-encodes and refuses non-canonical bytes, so `encode` stays the only way to make new bytes |
| `JudgeOutcome` serializes `answers`, `backend`, `input_sha256` (null), `provider_meta`; `probabilities` removed; `data.answers` written once from typed answers | REQ-SAG-0710, frozen a-1 contract, ADR-SAG-0014 r-1 interim | D10.1; per-answer keys outside `choice`/`confidence`/`probabilities` survive only in `provider_meta` (CPR-203 option a) |
| Live runs record `MultiBackendMode::ChainContext` and `Attestation::Unattested` per backend, so `equal = false` | ADR-SAG-0019 / 0008 r-1 interim, REQ-SAG-0710 | the engine passes prior answers to later LLM backends today, and no backend hashes until r-2b |
| Several fix-hint texts changed shape: `RegistryInvalid` and `SessionDocumentInvalid` render "{detail}. {recovery}", `SessionStoreIo` renders "{op} failed (cause: {kind}). {recovery}"; clock and `sc-jev-py` log-directory failures use `Operational { Config }` | REQ-SAG-0106 | `fix_hint` is the one renderer and the recovery fields are data; ids unchanged (golden `error-codes.json`) |
| `PartialEq<&str>` on `ErrorCode` and on the label newtypes; `retryable` stored as a bool that reads back `false`; `tempfile` dev-dependency on `sc-agent-types` | REQ-SAG-0106, NFR-SAG-0001 | test ergonomics; the reader is lenient on `false`, the writer never emits it; the `git` tests need temp repos |
| `git cat-file` gets no `--no-textconv` | D7.5 | git rejects the flag for `cat-file`; `cat-file blob` never applies textconv or filters. The helper honours user config (for example `safe.directory`), removes `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` and `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, and has no wall-clock deadline (output is bounded; r-2/r-3c callers own timeouts) |
| `BackendDescriptor`, `BACKENDS`, `BackendFamily` live in a private `catalog` module and `ErrorCode`, `NetworkErrorKind`, `OperationalArea` in a private `code` module, reached only through crate-root re-exports | D7.2 type homes, ADR-SAG-0027 | sc-boundary 0.8 reports a type cycle inside one module (`SCB-CYCLE-001`); the public paths are the crate root |
| `MockJudgeBackend` is not `Clone`; tests share it through `Arc`. `EqualInputRecord` serializes by hand | D10.11, D10.5 | `SCB-CYCLE-003` / `SCB-CYCLE-001` |
| "Subject.path" (D10.9) is read as `SubjectsSource.path: RepoRelativePath`; `SubjectsSource.blob_sha` is `BlobSha`; the id copy was in `sc-treesitter/src/extract.rs`, not `render.rs` | REQ-SAG-0108 | `Subject` has no path field |
| `RepoRelativePath` is adopted for `sc-jev-check` reads (its second validator is deleted), subjects documents and the `git` helpers; `InputSpec` and `CheckSpec` path fields stay `String` this sprint (r-2 owns `config`), and `sc-treesitter`'s CLI path handling moves in r-3c. Its rustdoc no longer says "the one validator" | RBP-F003 | half applied by design; finished by r-2 / r-3c |
| `JudgeOutcome::new(backend, &JudgeRequest, answers)` keeps the sprint-doc signature; `check_against(&PayloadBundle)` is the shared check and runs on session load | D10.2, RBP-F201 | QA suggested `&PayloadBundle`; deferred to r-2 with the engine API |
| `EqualInputRecord::new` returns `Result` (refuses an empty or duplicate backend list) | D10.5 | invariant of the derived `equal` |
| `ExtractInput` (sc-treesitter) is no longer `#[non_exhaustive]` | non_exhaustive triage | it has public fields and a builder; the rule forbids both |

> Later change: `ExtractInput`'s shape was changed by the phase-end API fixes
> (see the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for `sc_treesitter::ExtractInput`). It is
> `#[non_exhaustive]` again with private fields and accessors; the table row
> above and the "keeps public fields" sentence below describe r-1 only.

**`#[non_exhaustive]` triage additions:** `SubjectsSource`, `SubjectsProducer`
and `ChoiceAnswer` keep public fields: they are frozen wire types whose
fields are fixed by `sc/subjects/1` and the canonical payload, and a field
change is a schema version. `LlmWireContext` keeps its public
`system_prompt` beside `new` (one field, set by the facade). `ExtractInput`
keeps public fields and drops `#[non_exhaustive]`.

**Deferred to r-2, with reason:** `BackendSet` adoption in `sc-ai` and
`sc-jev-py` (their argv/API is r-2/r-3b's); `sc-jev` `check.rs` re-deriving
criteria from the payload instead of `question_choices()` (engine-side
validation is r-2's); `BackendCapabilities` copying descriptor facts
(kept as the D1.3 shape); `merge_jev_response`'s `unwrap_or(Value::Null)`
(the `RunResponse` serialization replaces it in r-2).

## This sprint does not close

Engine API, `InputSpec::Command.path`, `RunResponse::warnings`, the `git`
feature enablement in `sc-jev-check`, session store (r-2); backend-side
`input_sha256` hashing and multi-backend semantics (r-2b); HTTP crate and the
lint-enforced secret read site (r-3); `sc-treesitter` git migration and clap
(r-3c); composition crate and CI gates (r-3b); pins and allocator (r-4); D9
(r-5); typed `JudgeMeta` and async trait (Phase B); new stable error codes.
