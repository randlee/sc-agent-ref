# Sprint r-3 — `sc-agent-http` shared HTTP crate (D5)

## Outcome

One HTTP layer. `sc-jev` and `sc-jev-backends` become wire-format crates on
`sc-agent-http`, which owns request/response types, the transport trait,
`UreqTransport`, busy retry with a cancellation hook, caps and redaction, and
the single `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` call site. ADR-SAG-0026's HTTP half goes
Active here. ADR-SAG-0012 still holds: `sc-jev` owns every Jev API operation;
`sc-agent-http` only carries bytes.

## Closes findings

EXT-005, QA-003, RBQA-F003, RBP-F006, RBP-F007 (body), ARCHC-001, RSH-005;
a-10 follow-up "hidden `ResolvedApiKey::new`" is closed by r-1. Deleting
`sc-jev/src/client/https.rs` and `sc-jev-backends/src/transport.rs`
supersedes the ADR-SAG-0029 (a) sentence naming them as "the only production
readers" of `ResolvedApiKey::as_str`: from r-3 the one reader is
`crates/sc-agent-http/src/ureq_transport.rs` (ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 amendment).
ADR-SAG-0029 (a) already states that `sc-agent-secrets` has no Cargo
features; A.1 relies on it and does not restate it. (The
workspace-wide secret-read-site scan of RBQA-F003 lands in r-3b's
`workspace-tests --test source_scans`; r-3 lands the lint mechanism and a
local `rg` check.)

## Deliverables

1. **Crate** `crates/sc-agent-http` (published; `[lints] workspace = true`;
   depends on `sc-agent-types` with `default-features = false,
   features = ["secret"]` — `CancelToken` is in the always-on core since
   r-1 — and `ureq`; no `rand` or `url` crate: jitter comes from std
   (`std::hash::RandomState` hashed with the attempt time) and URL parsing
   uses ureq's re-exported `http::Uri` inside the private transport module).
   Modules and public items:
   - `request`: `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` with **private fields,
     constructors and accessors** (implementors of `Transport` build
     `HttpResponse`, so no public fields): `HttpRequest::new(method, endpoint, body: Arc<[u8]>)`,
     `with_header(name, value)`, `with_secret(SecretHeader)`, accessors
     `method()`, `endpoint()`, `headers()`, `secret()`, `body()`;
     `HttpResponse::new(status: u16, headers, body: Vec<u8>)`, accessors
     `status()`, `header(name)`, `body()`, `into_body()`. `Method`.
     `SecretHeader::new(name: HeaderName, value: ResolvedApiKey)` where
     `HeaderName` is a validated (RFC 9110 token) `&'static str` newtype.
     `Endpoint` is an https-validated URL newtype: `Endpoint::parse` accepts
     **only** `https://` in every build. The `test-util` feature adds
     `Endpoint::loopback_http(port: u16, path: &str)`, which can only build
     `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…`; it cannot be pointed at a non-loopback host,
     so the feature cannot open plain HTTP to the network even if a build
     enables it by mistake (and the `test-util` `cargo tree` gate keeps it
     out of normal graphs). `test_release_build_refuses_http` (target
     `ureq`, needs `--features test-util`) and the `--lib` unit test
     `ureq_transport::tests::test_endpoint_parse_refuses_http` (runs without
     any feature) both assert `Endpoint::parse("http://…")` is refused.
   - `transport`: `pub trait Transport: Send + Sync { fn send(&self, req: &HttpRequest) -> Result<HttpResponse, JevError>; }`.
     Open (test transports implement it). Direct `Transport::send` callers
     bypass busy retry **and** redaction; rustdoc says so, and production
     code calls only `send_with_busy_retry`.
   - `ureq_transport` (**private module**, file `src/ureq_transport.rs`;
     named so it does not shadow the `ureq` crate): `UreqTransport` is
     re-exported at the crate root. `UreqTransport::new(Timeouts) -> Self`
     builds **one** `ureq::Agent` in `new` (connect 10 s, global request
     timeout 120 s covering body read, no redirects, https only, versioned
     User-Agent) and reuses it. The agent settings come from one private
     `AgentConfig` value; `test_ureq_agent_config_values` (unit test,
     `--lib`, no network) asserts connect 10 s, global 120 s, redirects 0,
     https-only and the User-Agent string. Under `test-util` only,
     `UreqTransport::loopback_for_tests()` builds the same `AgentConfig` with
     https-only off, for `Endpoint::loopback_http` targets; the production
     constructor has no such switch. Response body cap **8 MiB**,
     enforced while streaming, for error bodies too. No `ureq` type is in
     any public signature: the module is private and the public-API check
     greps the generated docs. The check runs `cargo doc -p sc-agent-http`
     **without** `--no-deps`, so ureq's own docs exist and a leaked type
     renders as a link `../ureq/[<module>/]<kind>.<Name>.html` with
     `title="<kind> ureq::[<module>::]<Name>"`; it then fails on either form
     (QA-1 RBQA-F101 widened the href half to any link into `ureq/`, because
     types in ureq submodules, such as `ureq/agent/struct.Agent.html`, did
     not match the first form):
     `! grep -rlE 'href="[^"]*ureq/|title="[a-z]+ ureq::' target/doc/sc_agent_http/`
     (with `--no-deps` rustdoc may print a bare `Agent` and the gate could
     never fail, CPR-209). **Canary:** before the final commit, r-3 adds a
     throwaway `pub fn _canary() -> ureq::Agent` to `lib.rs`, runs the check,
     records in the PR that it fails and on which pattern, then deletes the
     canary. Rustdoc prose names the crate as "ureq" without a path. The
     proven command runs in CI (`sc-agent-ci.yml` job `deps`, added by r-3
     in QA-1; r-3b keeps it).
   - `retry`: `BusyPolicy` (private fields, constructor, `default()` per
     owner decision (b)), `send_with_busy_retry(&dyn Transport, &HttpRequest, &BusyPolicy, &CancelToken) -> Result<HttpResponse, JevError>`.
     Sleeping, the monotonic clock and jitter are part of `BusyPolicy`. The
     `test-util` feature adds `BusyPolicy::with_test_hooks(clock, sleeper, jitter)`
     (deterministic jitter, a fake monotonic clock, a recording sleeper);
     there is no public `RetrySleeper` in a normal build. `test-util` also
     exposes `test_util::{RecordingTransport, ScriptedTransport}` for the
     backend crates' tests.
   - `redact`: header and body redaction, applied **once**, inside
     `send_with_busy_retry`, to **every** `Err` it returns — the ones it
     builds and every `Err` a `Transport` impl returns (third-party
     transports included), whatever the variant: the error's text fields
     are passed through `redact` before they leave the function.
     `test_transport_error_with_secret_is_redacted` (target `retry`): a
     scripted transport returns an error whose detail contains the request's
     secret value; the returned error does not contain it.
   - **Tests and the seam.** The crate's integration targets `retry` and
     `ureq` are declared `[[test]] required-features = ["test-util"]` and
     their validation lines pass `--features test-util`; there is no self
     dev-dependency (r-1's D0 spike result, `boundaries/README.md`
     "Dev-dependency and self edges"; plan "Test seams"); loopback tests in
     `--test ureq` use `Endpoint::loopback_http` and run against a std
     `TcpListener` on 127.0.0.1.
2. **Retry rules** (owner decision (b), DECIDED 2026-11-06; REQ-SAG-0505
   amendment; ADR-SAG-0007 r-3 amendment). `BusyPolicy::default()`:
   statuses 429/502/529 only; at most 4 sends; a valid Retry-After honoured,
   clamped 0–30 s. **Retry-After grammar:** valid is 1–32 bytes matching
   `^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$` (ASCII digits, optional ASCII-digit fraction),
   parsed without `f64::from_str` (integer and fraction parts are parsed as
   digits, so NaN, infinity, sign, exponent and overflow cannot occur and
   `Duration::from_secs_f64` is never called on an unchecked value);
   anything else — HTTP-date, `-1`, `1e9`, `inf`, `NaN`, empty, > 32 bytes —
   is malformed. Absent **or malformed** Retry-After (treated alike) →
   exponential backoff 1, 2, 4, 8 … s capped at 30 s; with the default 4
   sends at most three waits occur (1, 2, 4 s), so 8 s and the cap are
   reached only by a non-default policy; up to 250 ms jitter on every wait;
   90 s budget from the first send for starting attempts, every wait
   `min(wait + jitter, budget_remaining)`, no attempt starts after the
   budget; an in-flight attempt keeps its 120 s request timeout. The
   `CancelToken` is checked before each attempt and every wait is sliced
   (≤ 100 ms slices), so a cancel during a wait returns
   `NetworkError { kind: Cancelled }` within 100 ms. A cancel during an
   in-flight request is observed only when that request returns: the
   worst-case cancel latency is the 120 s request timeout (rustdoc of
   `send_with_busy_retry` and the ADR-SAG-0007 r-3 amendment say so). Connect and DNS failures are
   not retried and there is no connectivity probing: they return
   `NetworkError { kind: Connect }` (`retryable() == true`) at once and the
   caller decides. A transport error or timeout after the body was sent is
   never retried. 502 retry can double-charge a provider that processed the
   request; documented in the amendment. Tests (target `retry`):
   `test_busy_policy_numbers` (default: three waits 1, 2, 4 s + jitter),
   `test_missing_and_malformed_retry_after_back_off_exponentially`,
   `test_retry_after_grammar` (table: `"3"`, `"2.5"` valid; `"0"` valid with
   a zero wait, bounded by the 4-send cap; 32 nines valid and saturating to
   the 30 s clamp without overflow; `"-1"`, `"1e9"`, `"inf"`, `"NaN"`, `""`,
   an HTTP-date, 33 digits malformed),
   `test_exhaustion_reason_distinguishable` (the error after the fourth
   send's busy status says "4 sends exhausted"; the error when the 90 s
   budget forbids the next attempt says "retry budget exhausted"; both are
   `NetworkError { kind: Busy }` with `retryable() == true`, distinguished by
   detail text),
   `test_retry_sleep_capped_by_budget`, `test_cancel_interrupts_sleep`,
   `test_no_retry_after_body_sent`, `test_connect_failure_returns_immediately_retryable`,
   `test_transport_error_with_secret_is_redacted`; all drive
   `BusyPolicy::with_test_hooks` (no real sleeping).
3. **Delete the parallel copies:** `sc-jev/src/client/{transport,retry,https}.rs`,
   `sc-jev-backends/src/{transport,retry}.rs`. Each crate keeps its wire
   builder and response parser. Backends are generic,
   `Backend<T: Transport = UreqTransport>`; `with_default_transport(key)`
   (r-1 signature) now builds `UreqTransport`. The `BackendTransport` /
   `JevTransport` traits disappear; tests use `sc-agent-http` test transports.
4. **Secret read site — honest mechanism** (ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 amendment). The
   secret travels only as `SecretHeader` (holding `ResolvedApiKey`) in
   `HttpRequest`. `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` stays `pub` and is listed in
   `clippy.toml` `disallowed-methods`. Its one call site,
   `crates/sc-agent-http/src/ureq_transport.rs`, carries
   `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "single secret read site (ADR-SAG-0020)")]`.
   Root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.lints.clippy]` sets `allow_attributes = "deny"`
   and `allow_attributes_without_reason = "deny"`, so a second site needs a
   visible `#[expect]`; r-1 already removed every `#[allow]`, and every
   crate has `[lints] workspace = true` (a-10; `sc-agent-http` adds it here).
   r-3's validation runs a local check (`rg`, below). The cross-crate proof
   is `workspace-tests --test source_scans` in r-3b (moved out of this
   published crate, RBQA-F003), governed by an r-3b-owned ADR-SAG-0020
   bullet, not by r-3's (ADR text, item 7): it scans **all** targets
   (`crates/**/*.rs`, incl. `tests/`, `benches/`, `examples/`, `build.rs`)
   for `disallowed_methods` in any `allow`/`expect` (item- or crate-level)
   outside `crates/sc-agent-http/src/ureq_transport.rs` (the type-aware half
   — an actual `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` call — is clippy's
   `disallowed-methods` under `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`), and
   asserts every `crates/*/Cargo.toml` has `[lints] workspace = true` and no
   per-crate `[lints.*]` override. This is a lint-enforced workspace
   convention, not a type seal; crates outside the workspace are not
   constrained. The round-1 `Token` /
   `__transport` design is dropped. Test transports see
   `SecretHeader::redacted()` and `SecretHeader::matches(&str)`.
5. **Root and manifests.** Root `Cargo.toml`: add member + workspace dep, add
   the two workspace clippy lints (`sc-observability-types` was already
   deleted by r-1).
   `sc-lint.toml` `ureq` record → `crates/sc-agent-http` only. Boundary
   manifests: `boundaries/sc-agent-http/agent-http.toml` (full text in
   plan.md); `sc-jev`/`sc-jev-backends` `allowed_dependencies -ureq +sc-agent-http`;
   `sc-agent-types` `allowed_dependents +sc-agent-http`. The
   `agent-http` manifest names the `test-util` feature in `notes`. Consumer
   input: add `sc-agent-http` with `publish_order: 3`, shift later crates by
   one, re-run `install.py` (r-3 owns the rendered files this wave).
   `sc-agent-http` takes caret dependencies only (NFR-SAG-0004:
   `check-exact-pins.sh` stays green).
6. **Crate docs.** `docs/sc-agent-http/requirements.md` (rows mapping to
   REQ-SAG-0402, REQ-SAG-0505, NFR-SAG-0002 and the ADR-SAG-0020 read site)
   and `docs/sc-agent-http/architecture.md` (modules, `Transport` contract,
   redaction rule, `test-util` seam, cancel latency), per the per-crate docs
   policy.
7. **ADR text.** ADR-SAG-0026 HTTP half → Active (states ADR-SAG-0012 still
   holds); ADR-level Status → "Active (HTTP half, r-3); host half
   Proposed (r-3b)"; index row ADR-SAG-0026 Status cell likewise. ADR-SAG-0006 r-3 amendment → Active. ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 amendment →
   Active, with its first bullet reworded at flip time so that it states
   only what r-3 enforces (below). ADR-SAG-0017 r-3 amendment (published library set gains
   `sc-agent-http`, publish order) → Active. ADR-SAG-0007 r-3 amendment →
   Active, with this bullet added (QA-1 ARCH-R3-001 / REQ-QA-R3-003) and the
   base sentence "configurable on backend builder for tests" marked
   superseded in part:

   > - (Active, r-3) HTTP timeouts (connect 10 s, request 120 s covering the
   >   body read) are construction state of the injected transport,
   >   `UreqTransport::new(Timeouts)`; `with_default_transport` uses
   >   `Timeouts::default()`, and a test or caller that needs other values
   >   passes `new(key, UreqTransport::new(Timeouts::new(..)))`. The backend
   >   builder `with_timeouts` is removed. This supersedes the base sentence
   >   "configurable on backend builder for tests".
 REQ-SAG-0505 and REQ-SAG-0130 r-3 bullets → Active.

   **ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 bullet 1, replacement wording** (plan review 4,
   pre-screen r-3 fix 1). The Active bullet must not name a mechanism that
   does not exist until wave 4. Replace the whole first bullet of
   "Amendment (Phase A.1, r-3)" with:

   > - (Active, r-3) A secret travels only as a `SecretHeader` holding
   >   `ResolvedApiKey` inside `sc_agent_http::HttpRequest`. The single read
   >   site is a **lint-enforced workspace convention, not a type seal**:
   >   `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` is listed in `clippy.toml`
   >   `disallowed-methods`; its one call site,
   >   `crates/sc-agent-http/src/ureq_transport.rs`, carries
   >   `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = ...)]`; workspace lints
   >   deny `allow_attributes` and `allow_attributes_without_reason`; every
   >   crate has `[lints] workspace = true`, checked locally by r-3's
   >   validation; and an `rg` check finds `disallowed_methods` in no file
   >   under `crates/` other than that call site. Crates outside the
   >   workspace are not constrained. Redaction is applied once, in
   >   `send_with_busy_retry`, to every error it returns, including errors a
   >   `Transport` impl returns; a caller of `Transport::send` directly
   >   bypasses it.

   The removed `source_scans` clause is not dropped: in the same edit r-3
   inserts, after the r-3 subsection, a new subsection
   "### Amendment (Phase A.1, r-3b)" with
   "**Status:** Proposed (Phase A.1) — lands in r-3b." and the bullet whose
   exact text is in sprint r-3b ("ADR text", ADR-SAG-0020 r-3b bullet), and
   adds "A.1 subsection (Proposed, r-3b)" to the ADR-SAG-0020 index row.
   r-3b owns that subsection and marker from then on.

   **Markers r-3 flips and markers it must not touch.** r-3 flips the
   "(Proposed, r-3)" markers in index rows 0006, 0007, 0017, 0020 and 0029,
   the HTTP-half parts of the ADR-SAG-0026 Status and Amends cells, and the
   ADR-SAG-0026 Status line. It must **not** flip: the r-3b markers in rows
   0010, 0011, 0013, 0016 and 0017 ("ADR-SAG-0026 (Proposed, r-3b)"), the
   compose-half part of the ADR-SAG-0026 row, the new ADR-SAG-0020 r-3b
   marker, the r-4 marker in rows 0016 and 0017 ("ADR-SAG-0023 (Proposed,
   r-4)", which r-4 flips), the ADR-SAG-0023 row, or ADR-SAG-0028.

## This sprint does not close

Backend-side `input_sha256` recovery and the `WireFault` hook (r-2b, which
consumes the final `HttpRequest.body` built here); async transport and
provider-agent request types (Phase B); D9 envelope (r-5); CI `cargo tree`
script rows, the CI public-API check and the workspace-wide source scans
(r-3b); a dependency-advisory (`cargo deny`/`cargo audit`) CI step (bead
`agt-ci-advisory-scan`, not an A.1 decision).

## Implementation notes

Developer validation at the D7 head (every "Required validation" line plus
the workspace gates: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features`,
`cargo test --workspace`, `cargo test -p sc-agent-http --features test-util`,
`cargo test -p sc-agent-types --features git,test-util`,
`cargo test -p sc-jev-check --features test-util`,
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`,
`cargo hack --each-feature test -p sc-treesitter` and `-p sc-agent-http`,
`cargo-tree-gates.sh`, `just test-python`, after `cargo fetch --locked`):
all pass; each named test line prints `1 passed`. `just lint` boundary output:
`sc-lint-boundary: pass (0 findings)`.

**Release render (REQ-QA-R3-001, resolved).** The dev session could not run
the sc-publish kit, so the parent ran the documented install
(`docs/development/sc-publish.md` "Install") at the pinned kit revision
`11b5b049` on 2026-11-07 and committed the re-rendered
`release/publish-artifacts.toml` as `8f969ff` (`sc-agent-http` at
`publish_order = 3`, later crates shifted). `install.py --dry-run` exited 0
and `scripts/sc-publish-dry-run.sh` reported "passed (all)"; no file under
`release/` or the kit workflows changed after `8f969ff`, and PR 26's
`dry-run` check is green. No kit-written file was hand-edited.
`run-consumer-preflight.sh`, `check-exact-pins.sh` and the
`cargo publish --dry-run --locked` line pass. Cargo packages a multi-`-p`
dry run in its own dependency order (`sc-agent-types`, `sc-agent-http`,
`sc-agent-secrets`, …): `sc-agent-http` depends only on `sc-agent-types`, so
cargo places it second; the `publish_order` the kit uses is the consumer
input's.

**Canaries.**
- Public-API check, first form (D-section run): a throwaway
  `pub fn _canary() -> ureq::Agent` failed only the title half; the href is
  `../ureq/agent/struct.Agent.html`, which `ureq/(struct|…)\.` misses.
- Public-API check, widened form (QA-1, RBQA-F101): the command is now
  `rm -rf target/doc/sc_agent_http && cargo doc -p sc-agent-http && ! grep -rlE 'href="[^"]*ureq/|title="[a-z]+ ureq::' target/doc/sc_agent_http/`.
  Canary in a throwaway `git worktree` with its own target dir: the href
  half alone (`href="[^"]*ureq/`) and the title half alone
  (`title="[a-z]+ ureq::`) each matched `fn._canary.html`
  (`<a class="struct" href="../ureq/agent/struct.Agent.html" title="struct ureq::agent::Agent">`),
  and the gate exited 1. On the real tree the grep matches nothing. The
  same command runs in CI (job `deps`) and is the text in plan.md and the
  r-3b doc.
- Read-site grep (QA-1, RBQA-F102, CI job `deps`): an extra
  `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "x")]` in `sc-jev` makes it
  fail; comment lines are ignored.
- `cargo-tree-gates.sh` rows (QA-1, RBQA-F104): turning off
  `default-features = false` on sc-agent-http's sc-agent-types edge fails the
  secret-only row (`default`, `judge`, …), and a normal `test-util` edge
  from sc-jev fails the workspace test-util row.
- Lints: a temporary `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` plus a second
  `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` call in `sc-jev` failed `cargo clippy -D warnings`
  with `allow_attributes`, `allow_attributes_without_reason` and
  `disallowed_methods`.
- `sc-lint.toml` ureq record: adding `ureq` to `crates/sc-jev/Cargo.toml`
  gives `SCB-MANIFEST-004` ("Only sc-agent-http may depend on ureq …").
- Agent reuse: with a second `UreqTransport` instead of a clone,
  `test_agent_is_reused_across_sends` fails (the one-connection server never
  answers a second connection).

**Deviations**, with the requirement or ADR each touches:

| Deviation | Touches | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public `Timeouts` (`new`, `connect`, `request`, `DEFAULT_*`, default 10 s / 120 s) and `HeaderName` added to the facade, with `test_util` | REQ-SAG-0402, boundary:agent-http, ADR-SAG-0026 | `UreqTransport::new(Timeouts)` and `HeaderName` are named by D1 but not by the plan facade text |
| `SecretHeader::bearer(key)` besides `new(name, key)` | ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` needs a prefix; `new` sends the key verbatim (`x-api-key`) |
| `SecretHeader::matches` is implemented in `ureq_transport.rs` through the one `expose` fn | ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | keeps a single `as_str` call site and a single `#[expect]` |
| `UreqTransport::loopback_for_tests(Timeouts)` takes timeouts | test-util seam | the loopback timeout test needs a short request timeout; production constructor unchanged |
| Exhaustion details: `HTTP <s> busy; N sends exhausted` / `HTTP <s> busy after N sends; retry budget exhausted`; backends prefix their name (`Jev …`, `luna …`) with `JevError::map_detail` | REQ-SAG-0505, ADR-SAG-0007 r-3 | RSH: distinguishable reasons; the old "retry attempts exhausted" wording in `jev_api`/`llm` tests updated |
| Malformed Retry-After now backs off (1, 2, 4 s) instead of waiting 30 s; `test_llm_busy_retry_same_body` expects 30, 1, 2 s | REQ-SAG-0505 (decided) | owner decision (b) |
| Removed `with_timeouts`, `with_retry_sleeper`, `JevClient::with_retry_delay`, `RetrySleeper`, `RetryDelay`, `DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` / `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`; added `with_busy_policy`, `with_cancel` on every backend | ADR-SAG-0006, ADR-SAG-0007 ("configurable … for tests") | timeouts are transport construction state (`new(key, UreqTransport::new(Timeouts::new(..)))`); supersedes a-10 ARCHC-018's `with_timeouts`; `test_with_timeouts_reaches_every_request` replaced by `test_timeouts_are_transport_construction_state` |
| `JevClient<T: Transport = UreqTransport>` is generic too; `with_config` keeps `jev.toml` `attempts` (packaged 4 = `BusyPolicy::default()`, test `packaged_attempts_match_the_shared_busy_policy`); `JevClientConfig::endpoint()` returns `&Endpoint`, validated in `try_new` | REQ-SAG-0400/0401, ADR-SAG-0009 (registry unchanged) | one transport model for every backend |
| `User-Agent` is `sc-agent-http/<ver>` for every backend (was `sc-jev/…`, `sc-jev-backends/…`) | REQ-SAG-0402 | one agent configuration |
| Also deleted: both `retry_policy.rs` and `test_server.rs` copies and the `shared_copies` test; loopback tests moved to `sc-agent-http --test ureq` (`tests/support/mod.rs`); the sc-jev client-over-loopback test is covered by `jev_api` (scripted) plus `--test ureq` | REQ-SAG-0402 | the copies existed only until D5 |
| Backends redact non-2xx snippets and reply-parse errors with `sc_agent_http::redact` (no redaction code of their own) | NFR-SAG-0002, ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | a response body may echo the key; `test_llm_non_2xx_detail_is_redacted` |
| `agent-http.toml`: no `sc-jev-host` forbidden edge; header comment added | boundary:agent-http | sc-lint 0.8.0 rejects an edge to a non-member (`CLI.CONFIG_ERROR`); r-3b adds it with the crate |
| `jev.toml` manifest lists `serde` (a direct dependency missing before) and both backend manifests add a `ureq` forbidden edge | boundary:jev, jev-backends | manifest completeness; the ureq record enforces it |
| `Endpoint::parse` failures are `CONFIG_INVALID`; the production transport refuses a non-https endpoint as `NETWORK_ERROR` kind `Tls` | REQ-SAG-0402 | no new error ids (planner resolution 5) |
| Frontmatter `adrs` adds ADR-SAG-0010 | ADR-SAG-0010 | the ureq ownership record's "stays HTTP-free" rule |

**Files outside `owned_paths`:** `Cargo.lock` (regenerated by cargo) and this
sprint doc (status, `adrs`, these notes).

### QA-1 fix round (PR 26, reviewed at `8f969ff`)

Merged `origin/integrate/phase-a` (r-3c, PR 25) at `6cad244`: `clippy.toml`
keeps r-3c's `allow-invalid = true` with r-3's single-read-site text;
`cargo-tree-gates.sh` keeps r-3c's `feature_rows` and adds r-3's rows as
`graph_rows`.

| Id | Requirement / ADR | Resolution | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI-R3-001 | REQ-SAG-0505 (connect failure retryable, not retried) | `test_connect_phase_failure_is_retryable_and_not_retried` accepts `Connect` or `Timeout` (Windows retries the SYN until the 2 s connect timeout); still asserts retryable and one send | `f6bf365` |
| REQ-QA-R3-001 | REQ-SAG-0130, boundary:release | parent kit re-render recorded above; frontmatter "open row" removed (status in-review until QA-2) | this commit |

| ARCH-R3-001, REQ-QA-R3-003 | ADR-SAG-0007 r-3 | Active bullet: timeouts are `UreqTransport::new(Timeouts)` construction state, `with_timeouts` removed; base sentence marked superseded in part; ADR text item 7 carries the bullet verbatim | `c85a8f6` |
| REQ-QA-R3-004 | a-10 ARCHC-018 | row notes "superseded by r-3 (Timeouts on UreqTransport::new)" | `c85a8f6` |
| RBQA-F101 | boundary:agent-http, ADR-SAG-0026 | widened gate, both halves proven, in CI and in plan.md / r-3b | `9b333dd`, `c85a8f6` |
| RBP-F007 | NFR-SAG-0002, ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | `send_and_parse` and `HttpClient<T>` in sc-agent-http redact the parse closure's error; both backends drop the tuple and every manual `redact`; call sites keep only the provider label (wire/check parse details no longer embed it, so it appears once) | `cc9c4cb`, `93e53d5` |
| RBQA-F102 | ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | CI grep: `disallowed_methods` or `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` outside `ureq_transport.rs` (non-comment lines) fails | `9b333dd` |
| RBQA-F103 | ADR-SAG-0020 r-3 | `SecretHeader::matches` exists only under `test-util`; manifest notes and docs say so | `136f3d2` |
| RBQA-F104, RBQA-F009 | boundary:agent-http, ADR-SAG-0016 | tree-gate rows: depth-1 no ureq (sc-jev, sc-jev-backends, sc-jev-check), sc-agent-http forbidden packages + ureq positive control, workspace no `test-util` in `-e normal,features` (+ dev-edge control), sc-agent-types `secret` only | `ebede9d` |
| FTQ-001 | — | stall test request timeout 1 s | `39454b4` |
| FTQ-002 | plan "Test seams" | CI test job runs `cargo test -p sc-agent-http --features test-util` on all three OSes | `9b333dd` |
| RBP minors | REQ-SAG-0402 | endpoints built once per `Provider`; request-build failure is `INPUT_INVALID` (deterministic, not retryable); oversize response is `RESPONSE_INVALID` on both paths (ureq `BodyExceedsLimit` mapped there; the `BodyTooLarge` mapping dropped; `NetworkErrorKind::BodyTooLarge` itself is sc-agent-types', unchanged); `test_util` documents its `Arc<Mutex<_>>` | `cc9c4cb`, `0b208fd` |
| RSH observations | REQ-SAG-0505, ADR-SAG-0007 | `JevClientConfig` attempts 1..=4, timeout ≤ 120 s, with a bounds test; retry docs give the double-charge rationale | `0b208fd` |
| QA-001 | NFR coverage baseline | tests for sc-jev `check.rs`, client cancel/labels, backends `validate.rs`, cancel/labels, sc-agent-http adapters and doubles. Line coverage (`cargo llvm-cov --workspace --exclude sc-jev-py --all-features`): workspace 90.08 → 92.44 %; sc-agent-http 92.30 → 97.52; sc-jev 78.94 → 97.83; sc-jev-backends 87.76 → 95.56 | `93e53d5` |
| QA-002 | REQ-SAG-0505 | kind stays `Busy`; `BusyExhaustion::of(&JevError)` returns `Sends` / `Budget` from the fixed detail endings (`SENDS_SUFFIX`, `BUDGET_SUFFIX`), unaffected by a backend label; asserted in `test_exhaustion_reason_distinguishable` | `3c1c6a8` |

Fix-round validation: every "Required validation" line and workspace gate
passes (48 of 48; log kept by the developer). One local note: the
multi-`-p` `cargo publish --dry-run --locked` first failed with
`unresolved import sc_agent_http::HttpClient` because cargo reused an
sc-agent-http 0.1.0 build from an earlier dry run (same unpublished version,
same overlay-registry id, treated as immutable). Run with a fresh
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, as CI does, it exits 0 and uploads all eight crates.

New public items: `send_and_parse`, `HttpClient`, `BusyExhaustion` (facade
updated). `send_and_parse` leaves the request with the caller, so a later
send-site digest (owner decision for r-6) can read `request.body()` without a
shape change. Files outside the original `owned_paths` in this round are the
five parent-authorized paths listed in the frontmatter.
