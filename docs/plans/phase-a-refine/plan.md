# Phase A.1 — architectural refinement

> **Historical record (phase-end digests, 2026-11-08).** This document records
> the pre-rename names and the version 1 session-log DDL as they were planned
> and built: `prompt_sha256` is now `payload_sha256`, the `questions` table
> keyed by the payload digest is now `question_sets` plus `payloads`
> (`schema_version` 2), and `questions_sha256` and per-backend `request_sha256`
> were added. It is not rewritten. The current schema and migration notes are in
> [`docs/sc-decision-schema/session-log-schema.md`](../../sc-decision-schema/session-log-schema.md).

Status: **complete** — all ten sprints (r-1, r-4, r-2, r-3, r-3c, r-2b, r-3b,
r-7, r-5, r-6) have landed on `integrate/phase-a`. Plan review rounds 1 to 6
(round 5 included) are recorded in these dispositions:
round 1 [`plan-review-1-dispositions.md`](plan-review-1-dispositions.md),
round 2 [`plan-review-2-dispositions.md`](plan-review-2-dispositions.md),
round 3 [`plan-review-3-dispositions.md`](plan-review-3-dispositions.md),
round 4 (wave-2 ADR pre-screen) [`plan-review-4-dispositions.md`](plan-review-4-dispositions.md),
round 5 (waves 3-5 ADR pre-screen) [`plan-review-5-dispositions.md`](plan-review-5-dispositions.md),
round 6 (r-6 pre-screen; r-7 split) [`plan-review-6-dispositions.md`](plan-review-6-dispositions.md).

Phase id: `r`. Plan branch: `plan/phase-a-refine`. Integration branch:
`integrate/phase-a` (A.1 lands on the Phase A integration branch before
`integrate → develop`). Beads epic: `agt-phase-a-refine` (create at kickoff).
Sprint doc shape follows `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/sprint-planning-guidelines.md`.

**Plan PR route (CPR-210, ARCH-019).** The plan PR (PR 19) targets
`integrate/phase-a`, not `develop`: every sprint branches from
`integrate/phase-a` and owns `(Proposed, r-N)` rows and subsections that
must already be there. This is a recorded exception to the plan-PR-to-develop
default, for the same reason A.1 lands on the Phase A integration branch.
**Merge order:** PR 20 (a-10 phase-end hardening, which adds ADR-SAG-0029)
merges into `integrate/phase-a` first; the plan branch then rebases onto
`integrate/phase-a` and takes a-10's text for ADR-SAG-0029, the
*Superseded by ADR-SAG-0029* markers in ADR-SAG-0020/0022 and
`docs/sc-jev-py/architecture.md`. Conflict rule for the ADR index rows 0020
and 0022: keep both markers, e.g. `Amends ADR-SAG-0009; amended by
ADR-SAG-0029; ADR-SAG-0024 (Proposed, r-2)`. The plan PR merges next, so
every `Proposed` row and subsection is on `integrate/phase-a` before r-1 and
r-4 branch from it.

**Repository exception (REQ-QA-012, REQ-QA-R2-008):** the phase id is `r`
while the docs directory and plan branch are named `phase-a-refine`. A.1
refines Phase A rather than opening a new phase, so its documents sit beside
`docs/plans/phase-a/` under a descriptive name; sprint ids, branches and beads
use `r-N`. The exception is recorded, naming `req-qa` and `arch-qa`, in
`.claude/project/quality-policy.md` "Repository exceptions" by this plan PR.

## Intent

Phase A delivered a working Jev check client, but its engine has four entry
points, its consumers duplicate orchestration, its backend set and error
taxonomy are closed, two HTTP stacks have drifted, and two guarantees
(equal-input, the `{path}` producer contract) are hollow. Phase A.1 makes
Phase A a foundation that Phase B (API-direct agents, MCP server) can extend
with **minor-version** changes only: one types break before the first
crates.io publish, one engine API, one HTTP layer, one composition crate, and
honest multi-backend semantics. Decisions are D1–D13 in `PHASE-A-REVIEW.md`
§4, all accepted 2026-11-06 (§7). Where plan reviewers disagreed, the
critical-plan-reviewer's structural points and arch-qa's ADR sequencing win;
other design points are applied unless they contradict an accepted D decision.

## Preconditions

- Both a-10 routine tracks (`sprint/a-10-phase-end-hardening`,
  `sprint/a-10-docs-ci-boundaries`) merged to `integrate/phase-a`. Their items
  (PHASE-A-REVIEW §3) are **not** re-planned here; A.1 builds on them:
  `impl FromStr for BackendId`, unified retry numbers, `ResolvedApiKey::try_new`,
  private `PayloadBundle` fields, `env_clear` + allowlist for command
  extractors, canonicalized `starts_with`-checked regular-file worktree reads,
  `.github/workflows/sc-agent-ci.yml`, the `sc-lint.toml`
  `global_dependency_ownership` records, and option-B boundary manifests.
  Every A.1 path below is read against that tree.

## Conventions used by every sprint doc

- **Section-scoped ownership of the two index docs.** `docs/architecture.md`
  and `docs/requirements.md` are edited by every sprint that lands ADR or REQ
  text. Each sprint's `owned_paths` names them as
  `docs/architecture.md#<section>` / `docs/requirements.md#<row>`. Within a
  wave no section or row is owned twice. Every amendment bullet carries a
  marker `(Proposed, r-N)` that the owning sprint flips to `(Active, r-N)`;
  each amendment subsection lands in exactly one sprint and has one
  **Status** line.
- **ADR index table** (CPR-M205, RBQA-F105). This plan PR writes every
  ADR-SAG-0023..0028 row of the `docs/architecture.md` ADR index as
  `Proposed (r-N)` and fills **every** "Amends / amended by" cell. One rule:
  a new ADR's cell lists each older ADR whose A.1 amendment subsection it
  drives (so ADR-SAG-0023, 0024, 0025, 0026 and 0027 all have an Amends
  list), and each older ADR's cell lists, with a `(Proposed, r-N)` marker,
  every A.1 subsection it receives: as "ADR-SAG-00NN (Proposed, r-N)" when a
  new ADR drives it, or as "A.1 subsection (Proposed, r-N)" when only a D
  decision does (ADR-SAG-0005 r-4 and r-5, ADR-SAG-0020 r-1, ADR-SAG-0022
  r-1). A landing sprint flips only its own row's **Status** cell and its
  own marker text; it never adds or removes an entry, row or cell. Each
  sprint names them in `owned_paths` as `docs/architecture.md#ADR index row
  ADR-SAG-00NN (Status cell)` / `#ADR index Amended-by marker (r-N) in
  ADR-SAG-00NN`. Plan-QA check: every row of the ADR ownership table below
  appears in an index cell.
- **Adjacent rows.** Two sprints of one wave that own adjacent rows of
  `docs/requirements.md` or the ADR index can produce a textual merge
  conflict without a semantic overlap. The second sprint of the wave to merge
  rebases and resolves it, keeping both rows' text verbatim.
- **Wave-1 merge order.** r-1 merges before r-4. r-1 deletes the last user
  and the root entry of `sc-observability-types`, and r-4's
  `check-exact-pins.sh` fails on that `=` entry, which is not on the
  ADR-SAG-0023 list; r-4 rebases onto r-1 and runs its validation on the
  rebased tree. Development runs in parallel.
- **Test seams: one mechanism.** A library hook that an integration test
  (`crates/<crate>/tests/*.rs`) needs is behind a non-default, additive
  `test-util` cargo feature of the crate that owns the hook. Other crates'
  tests enable it through their dev-dependencies. The crate's **own**
  integration targets do not use a self dev-dependency: r-1's D0 spike
  (RBQA-F101) took outcome 4, "dev edges counted, self edge flagged and self
  entry rejected", recorded in `boundaries/README.md` "Dev-dependency and
  self edges" (sc-boundary flags a path-only self edge with
  `SCB-MANIFEST-002`, no manifest entry clears it, and a versioned self
  edge cannot be packaged, CPR-M210). Each own target that needs the hook
  is declared `[[test]] name = "<t>" required-features = ["test-util"]`,
  and every validation line for it passes `--features test-util`; r-2
  (`sc-jev-check`), r-3 (`sc-agent-http`), r-2b (`sc-jev`,
  `sc-jev-backends`) and r-3b (`sc-ai`) apply this. Proposed ADR text that
  still says "self dev-dependency" is stale until its owner rewords it: the
  "Correction" sentence of the ADR-SAG-0022 r-2 amendment is reworded by r-2,
  and the ADR-SAG-0028 "Built-binary contract" sentence by r-3b (exact
  replacement wording in each sprint doc's "ADR text"). `test-util` never appears in a normal-dependency edge:
  the `cargo tree` gate row `test-util` (below), `workspace-tests --test
  test_util_off` (graph query) and `--test test_util_off_binary` (a
  release-built `sc-ai` that rejects `--scripted-answers`) and the release-wheel check prove it.
  **Maturin-feature exception** (ADR-SAG-0029 (b), ARCH-019): the pytest
  wheel is built with `maturin --features extension-module,test-util`, a
  command-line feature rather than a dev-dependency, because a Python test
  cannot have a Cargo dev-dependency; it exposes
  `sc_jev_py._testing.run_check_scripted`, and the default `maturin build`
  (the publish wheel) has no `_testing` submodule. Every boundary manifest
  of a crate with the feature names it in `notes`. A test that cannot use a
  `test-util` hook is a `--lib` unit test named as
  `cargo test -p <crate> --lib -- <module>::tests::<name> --exact`. No
  acceptance test in `tests/` depends on `cfg(test)`. Hooks by crate:
  `sc-agent-types` `test_util::MockJudgeBackend` (r-1; the one
  `JudgeBackend` double: requests, validations, provider meta, reported
  digest, `with_failure`, `refusing`);
  `sc-agent-http` `BusyPolicy::with_test_hooks` (clock, sleeper, jitter),
  `Endpoint::loopback_http` and `test_util::{RecordingTransport, ScriptedTransport}` (r-3);
  `sc-jev-check` `RunResponse::test_builder` (r-2) and
  `register_scripted_backends` (a-10; built over the mock by r-1; per-backend
  form r-2b); `sc-jev` / `sc-jev-backends` `WireFault` wire-builder hook
  (r-2b); `sc-ai` hidden `--scripted-answers` flag (r-3b);
  `sc-jev-py` `_testing` submodule (a-10, maturin feature). From r-7,
  `MockJudgeBackend` is `sc_decision_schema::test_util::MockJudgeBackend`
  (feature `test-util` of `sc-decision-schema`; ADR-SAG-0022 r-7 amendment).
- **Lint hygiene.** Every workspace crate, existing and new, has
  `[lints] workspace = true` and no per-crate `[lints]` override (a-10 added
  it to the eight existing crates; r-3 and r-3b add it to the three new
  ones). No allow attribute exists under `crates/` from r-1 on; suppressions
  are `#[expect(.., reason = "..")]`. Sprints r-1 to r-2b run the cheap
  `! rg -n '#!?\[allow\(' crates/` gate; from r-3b on the single robust
  check is `workspace-tests --test source_scans` (`test_no_allow_attributes`
  reads attributes whole, across lines, including `cfg_attr`), which
  replaces the `rg` gate. The scan builds its needles from fragments, so it
  never matches itself, and no path is excluded (CPR-M207, RBQA-F107).
- **Generated files.** `Cargo.lock` is regenerated, never hand-edited; the
  second sprint of a wave to merge re-runs `cargo check --workspace` and
  commits the result. Files rendered by sc-publish `install.py` (`release/**`
  other than the consumer input, `.github/workflows/*-publish.yml`,
  `release*.yml`, `prerelease-archive.yml`, `sc-publish-dry-run.yml`) are
  owned by the sprint that edits `release/sc-publish-consumer-input.json` and
  re-runs `install.py`: r-4 (wave 1), r-3 (wave 2), r-3b (wave 4), r-7
  (wave 5; the parent runs the kit `install.py` after r-7's consumer-input
  edit).
- **Validation honesty.** Every named test runs as
  `cargo test -p <crate> --test <target> -- <name> --exact` against a
  top-level `#[test] fn` in `crates/<crate>/tests/<target>.rs`, or as
  `cargo test -p <crate> --lib -- <module>::tests::<name> --exact`. Each such
  line must print `1 passed`; the scrum-master rejects `0 passed`.
  `cargo publish --dry-run` always uses the full ordered package list of the
  crates that exist at that point. The `just lint` boundary output
  (`sc-lint lint sc-boundary`) is attached to the QA input of r-1 (with the
  D0 spike result), r-3, r-3b, r-4.
- **Publish order** (crates.io): `sc-agent-types`, `sc-agent-secrets`,
  `sc-agent-http` (from r-3), `sc-jev`, `sc-jev-backends`, `sc-jev-check`,
  `sc-jev-host` (from r-3b), `sc-treesitter`, `sc-ai`; from r-7 the
  order in r-7 D1.5 (`sc-decision-schema` second). `sc-jev-py` ships
  to PyPI only. `workspace-tests` is `publish = false`.

## Boundary map

Read from `boundaries/*/*.toml` and the crate manifests after a-10. Every
sprint's `owned_paths` is derived from this table; a sprint owns a row's
paths only in the wave named.

| Crate / file | Manifest | Contract delta in A.1 | Owning sprint (wave) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sc-agent-types` | `boundaries/sc-agent-types/agent-types.toml` | The whole types break (D1, D6, D7, D10-break, D11 types part): `BackendDescriptor` static facts + `BACKENDS`; provided `capabilities()`; `BackendCapabilities` ctor + private fields; explicit `JevError` variants (constructor per struct-like variant) + `ProducerError`; `ErrorCode`; `ScAgentErrorResponse` `schema_version`/`retryable`/`details` with a per-field rule (`from_jev_error` name kept); `NetworkErrorKind`; `retryable()`; `RepoRelativePath`, `QuestionId`, `ChoiceId`, `BlobSha`, `Operation`, `BackendSet`, `CancelToken` (always-on core); typed `answers`; `JudgeOutcome.input_sha256: Option`; `Attestation` enum; `MultiBackendMode`; `PayloadBundle::encode`; private `CanonicalJudgePayload` fields; `schema::subjects` + `SubjectsBuilder`, `SubjectsDocument` as the one validated type; `LogRejected`; `git` module; features `judge`/`secret`/`obs` (default) and `git` (non-default), `test-util`; `ResolvedApiKey` on `Arc<str>`, unchecked `new` deleted in every build; `QuestionAnswer.confidence`; `PayloadBundle::question_choices`; `sha2` in core; `MockJudgeBackend` full contract (r-1 D10.11); the a-10 `#[allow]` in `ids.rs` → `#[expect]`. Manifest: facade, features, `-sc-observability-types`, the D0 spike paragraph in `boundaries/README.md` (r-1); `allowed_dependents` `+sc-agent-http` (r-3), `+sc-jev-host` and (in the "dev edges counted" branch of r-1's D0 spike) `+workspace-tests` (r-3b) | r-1 (1); manifest r-3 (2), r-3b (4); decision types moved out, model catalog, `SendTrace`, `ProjectLabel` r-7 (5); ULID, `sc-sha`, `LogEvent` fields r-6 (6). `judge.rs` moves to `sc-decision-schema` in r-7, so r-5's payload edit lands there |
| `sc-decision-schema` (new, published) | `boundaries/sc-decision-schema/decision-schema.toml` (new) | Created (ADR-SAG-0030): the decision types moved from `sc-agent-types`, `DecisionSchemaId` versions, `llm::v1`, `variants`, `session_log` (DDL + `fields{}` projection, ADR-SAG-0031), `JudgeBackend::model_id`, `judge(req, &SendTrace)`, `test_util::MockJudgeBackend`. Manifest text in the r-7 sprint doc. r-5 owns `payload.rs` + `jev/**` (`jev::v1`) (6); r-6 owns `MockJudgeBackend::with_sent_body` (6) | r-7 (5), r-5 (6), r-6 (6) |
| `sc-agent-secrets` | `boundaries/sc-agent-secrets/agent-secrets.toml` | Call sites only (`ResolvedApiKey` shape). No manifest change | r-1 (1) |
| `sc-agent-http` (new, published) | `boundaries/sc-agent-http/agent-http.toml` (new) | Created: `HttpRequest` (`body: Arc<[u8]>`, later `Arc<str>` per r-7), `HttpResponse`, `Method`, `Endpoint`, `SecretHeader`, `Transport`, `UreqTransport`, `BusyPolicy`, `send_with_busy_retry`, `redact`. Manifest text below | r-3 (2), r-7 required `SendTrace` parameter on the exchange fns (5), r-6 digest recording in `retry.rs` (6) |
| `sc-jev` | `boundaries/sc-jev/jev.toml` | r-1: infallible `JevClient::new`, `with_default_transport`, descriptor-read byte cap, typed answers (with `confidence`), `#[allow]` in `client/https.rs` → `#[expect]`. r-3: `client/{transport,retry,https}.rs` deleted, built on `sc-agent-http`; `JevClient` stays in `client/mod.rs`; dependencies `-ureq +sc-agent-http`. r-2b (`check.rs`, `client/**`, `lib.rs`): `input_sha256` recovered from the final body; `test-util` feature with the `WireFault` hook and `JevClient::with_wire_fault`; real-wire-builder digest test. r-5: envelope | r-1 (1), r-3 (2), r-2b (3), r-7 imports, `ModelId` config, `fn model_id`, request-trace hand-off (5), r-5 (6) |
| `sc-jev-backends` | `boundaries/sc-jev-backends/jev-backends.toml` | Same split as `sc-jev` (r-1 ctor/limit/answers and the `transport.rs` `#[allow]`; r-3 transport; r-2b digest, `test-util`/`WireFault`, real-wire-builder digest test; r-5 validate) | r-1 (1), r-3 (2), r-2b (3), r-7 imports, catalog model, `fn model_id`, request-trace hand-off, `llm::v1` parse (5), r-5 `validate.rs`/`wire.rs` (6) |
| `sc-jev-check` | `boundaries/sc-jev-check/jev-check.toml` | r-1: call sites, session document v2, `InputSpec` moved in unchanged from types, private backend factory table (`--lib` coverage test), `ScriptedJudge`/`RequestLog` deleted (`register_scripted_backends` over `MockJudgeBackend`), and the one `Cargo.toml` line `test-util = ["sc-agent-types/test-util"]`. r-2: `Cargo.toml` (`sc-agent-types` `features = ["git"]`, `[[test]] required-features = ["test-util"]` entries; no self dev-dependency), `prepare`/`run`/`discover_repo_root`, `RunConfig`, `PreparedRun`, `CheckSource`, `CallerRequest`, `RunResponse` (incl. `warnings`) + `Envelope`, `RunResponse::test_builder` (`test-util`), `FileSessionStore`, `BackendRegistry::{from_env, register}`, `InputSpec::Command.path`; facade rewritten. r-2b: run-loop semantics, `registry/scripted.rs` digest reporting. r-3b: manifest `allowed_dependents` `+sc-jev-host` (and `+workspace-tests` in the "dev edges counted" branch of r-1's D0 spike) | r-1 (1), r-2 (2), r-2b (3), r-3b manifest (4), r-7 imports + `[models]` (5), r-6 row emission, ULID, `discover_main_repo_root` (6) |
| `sc-jev-host` (new, published) | `boundaries/sc-jev-host/jev-host.toml` (new) | Created: `obs`, `paths::PathPolicy`, `compose::{run_from, ask_from}`, `ComposeInputs`. Manifest text below | r-3b (4), r-7 imports (5), r-6 `obs.rs` + `compose.rs` (6) |
| `sc-ai` | `boundaries/sc-ai/sc-ai-cli.toml` | r-1: call sites incl. `main.rs` (error-variant migration; `command.rs` id equality → descriptor fact). r-4: `Cargo.toml` only — `cli` feature, optional mimalloc + clap, `[[bin]] required-features = ["cli"]` (the unconditional `#[global_allocator]` then compiles only with `cli`; `main.rs` unchanged). r-2: engine migration. r-3b: clap parser, compose, partial-failure stdout/stderr/exit 2, `--chain-context`; dependencies `-sc-observability +sc-jev-host` | r-1 (1), r-4 (1, `Cargo.toml` only), r-2 (2), r-3b (4), r-7 imports (5), r-6 `--project` + ULID (6) |
| `sc-jev-py` | `boundaries/sc-jev-py/jev-py.toml` | r-1: call sites. r-2: engine migration. r-3b: compose, `chain_context` kwarg, `JevError.response`, `.pyi`; dependencies `-sc-observability +sc-jev-host`; `jev_cross_impl` `[[test]]` deleted | r-1 (1), r-2 (2), r-3b (4), r-7 imports (5), r-6 `project=` + ULID (6) |
| `sc-treesitter` | `boundaries/sc-treesitter/treesitter.toml` | r-1: `SubjectsBuilder`, producer-neutral variants — owns `src/grammar.rs`, `src/query.rs`, `src/git_io.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/render.rs`, `src/extract.rs`, `src/lib.rs` for the error-variant migration. r-4: `Cargo.toml` only (`cli` feature, `[[bin]] required-features`). r-3c: clap parser (`main.rs`, `cli/`), `git` helper (`git_io.rs`), `sc-agent-types` `default-features = false`; dependencies `+clap` (optional) | r-1 (1), r-4 (1, `Cargo.toml` only), r-3c (2) |
| `workspace-tests` (new, `publish = false`) | `boundaries/workspace-tests/workspace-tests.toml` (new) | Created: targets `jev_cross_impl`, `e2e_treesitter_producer`, `consumer_parity`, `git_read_parity`, `source_scans` (allow attributes, `disallowed_methods` expect sites, lint-mechanism presence, lints inheritance, environment-read owners), `test_util_off` (graph) and `test_util_off_binary` (release binary); helper `tests/support/bin_path.rs` (release builds, isolated target dir); one `README.md` paragraph per target, no `docs/workspace-tests/`. Manifest text below | r-3b (4), r-7 imports (5), r-6 ULID goldens (6) |
| Root `Cargo.toml` | — | r-1: deletes the one `sc-observability-types` line in `[workspace.dependencies]` (section-scoped: that line only). r-4: every other `[workspace.dependencies]` change — caret pins, `clap` workspace dep, `mimalloc` caret, pin-policy comment. r-3: `sc-agent-http` member + dep, `[workspace.lints.clippy]` `allow_attributes = "deny"`, `allow_attributes_without_reason = "deny"`. r-3b: `sc-jev-host`, `workspace-tests` members | r-1 (1, one line), r-4 (1), r-3 (2), r-3b (4), r-7 `sc-decision-schema` member + dep (5), r-6 `ulid`/`sc-sha` (6) |
| `sc-lint.toml` | — | Ownership records, table below | r-4 (1), r-3 (2), r-3b (4), r-6 (6) |
| `.github/workflows/sc-agent-ci.yml`, `.github/scripts/cargo-tree-gates.sh`, `.github/scripts/check-exact-pins.sh` | — | r-4: `--no-default-features` lib builds, mimalloc gates, pin check reading the ADR-SAG-0023 list, `cargo hack check -p sc-agent-types --feature-powerset`; the a-10 `cargo hack --each-feature test -p sc-treesitter` step kept (green through `[[test]] required-features`). r-3b: every remaining gate row (default and `--no-default-features`), the `test-util` row, the r-3c and r-3 `sc-agent-types` feature rows, the duplicate-version rows, the public-API (`cargo doc`, with deps) check in r-3's proven form, the release-wheel check, isolated per-library `cargo build -p <lib>` rows, `workspace-tests` job; pin check re-run | r-4 (1), r-3b (4), r-7 (5) |
| `clippy.toml` | — | r-3: `disallowed-methods` for `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` (a-10) with the A.1 reason text. r-3b: `std::process::Command::new` added, after r-2 and r-3c moved every `git` caller to `sc_agent_types::git` | r-3 (2), r-3b (4) |
| `boundaries/README.md` | — | r-1: "Dev-dependency and self edges" paragraph (D0 spike result). r-3b: `SCB-MANIFEST-004` row drops `sc-observability-types` | r-1 (1), r-3b (4) |

**`vertical_rationale` for r-1:** a contract break of the shared types crate
cannot leave the workspace red, and nothing is published, so the sprint that
changes the types also updates every call site and every test it breaks
(`crates/*/src/**` call sites including both `main.rs` and every
`sc-treesitter` source file that constructs a `JevError` variant,
`crates/*/tests/**`). No behaviour above the contract changes in r-1 except
where a type change forces it (session document version, descriptor-read byte
cap, `ScAgentErrorResponse` fields).

**`vertical_rationale` for r-2:** the four deleted entry points have callers
in `sc-ai` and `sc-jev-py`; D2 forbids shims, so the consumer call sites move
in the same commit. r-2 changes no consumer behaviour beyond the response
shape pinned by `test_run_response_contract`.

**`vertical_rationale` for r-3:** `sc-agent-http` does not exist yet; r-3
creates it and moves its only two consumers (`sc-jev`, `sc-jev-backends`)
onto it.

**`vertical_rationale` for r-3b:** integration sprint; it creates the
composition crate and the cross-crate test crate and moves both composition
roots onto them.

### Ownership records in `sc-lint.toml`

| Dependency | Allowed manifests / source roots | Owning sprint |
| --- | --- | --- |

### `cargo tree` gates

`.github/scripts/cargo-tree-gates.sh` runs each row **twice**, with default
features and with `--no-default-features`, as
`cargo tree -p <crate> -e normal [--no-default-features]` (depth 1 where
noted), except rows marked *(lib)*, which run `--no-default-features` only
(the default `cli` feature of a binary crate legitimately links clap and
mimalloc). A row fails if a pattern matches. Patterns are word-bounded on the
package name and version so `sc-jev` does not match `sc-jev-check`:
`grep -E '(^|[^[:alnum:]_-])<name> v[0-9]'`.

| Crate | Must be absent | Added by |

| `sc-treesitter` *(lib)* | `mimalloc`, `clap`, `sc-observability`; `-e normal,features -i sc-agent-types`: features `judge`, `secret`, `obs`, `git` | r-4 (mimalloc), r-3c (local clap and features), r-3b (script); r-7 drops `judge` (feature deleted) |
| `sc-jev-py` | depth-1 `sc-observability`, `ureq` | r-3b |
| `sc-ai`, `sc-jev-py` | `-e normal -d` (duplicate versions): `sc-jev-check`, `sc-agent-types`, `sc-jev-host`. Compose's signatures name `sc-jev-check` types and only compose is `=`-pinned, so a split version would give two incompatible `RunResponse` types (RBQA-F106 (b)) | r-3b |
| `workspace-tests` | `pyo3`, `tree-sitter` (`-e normal,dev`). (Dev edges are counted by `sc-boundary` per the D0 outcome, so the dev set is policed by the manifest, not by a tree row.) | r-3b |
| every workspace crate | `-e normal,features` (no dev edges): feature `test-util` of any workspace crate | r-3b |
| `sc-decision-schema` | rows in r-7 D1.6 | r-7 |

`boundaries/workspace-tests/workspace-tests.toml` (r-3b), full text below.
`allowed_dependencies` is the exact workspace dev set. r-1's D0 spike settled
how `sc-boundary` treats dev-only workspace edges (outcome 4, `boundaries/README.md`
"Dev-dependency and self edges"): dev edges are counted, so this text lands as
written and the three dependency manifests (`sc-agent-types`, `sc-jev-check`,
`sc-jev-host`) add `workspace-tests` to `allowed_dependents`. Third-party
dev-deps (`serde_json`, `tempfile`) are not checked by `sc-boundary`. The schema
rejects `facade = ""`, so the facade is `"workspace_tests"` (the empty crate root).

boundary_id = "BOUNDARY-workspace-tests"
owner_package = "workspace-tests"
owner_crate_path = "workspace_tests"

Edits to existing manifests: `sc-agent-types` facade (`schema::subjects`,
`git`, features, `test-util`), `-sc-observability-types` from its
dependency list (r-1), `allowed_dependents` `+sc-agent-http` (r-3),
`+sc-jev-host` and `+workspace-tests` (r-3b; dev edges are counted); `sc-jev` / `sc-jev-backends`
`allowed_dependencies` `-ureq +sc-agent-http`, forbidden `ureq` direct is
enforced by the r-3 ownership record (r-3); `sc-jev-check` facade rewritten
(r-2), `allowed_dependents` `+sc-jev-host` and `+workspace-tests` (r-3b); the "counted, self entries accepted"
branch (each crate with a self dev-dependency lists itself) was NOT taken —
D0 resolved to outcome 4 (`boundaries/README.md`), so no self entries exist;
`sc-ai` / `sc-jev-py` `allowed_dependencies` `-sc-observability
+sc-jev-host`, forbidden `sc-observability`, `ureq` (r-3b), `sc-ai`
`+clap`, `+mimalloc` optional (r-3b; r-4 adds the dependency and the
`sc-lint.toml` record only); `sc-treesitter` `+clap` optional, `+mimalloc`
optional, facade and `git` note (r-3c). Every manifest of a crate with a
`test-util` feature names it in `notes` (the sprint that adds the feature).

## Sprints and waves

| Decision(s) | Sprint | Title | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1, D6, D7 (types), D10-break, D11 (types), RBQA-F006 helper | r-1 | sc-agent-types break | XL |
| D8, D13 (ADR-SAG-0005 kinds sentence) | r-4 | pins, allocator, released binaries | M |
| D2 (engine), D4, D11 (engine), D13 (engine cap removal) | r-2 | engine shape | L |
| D5 | r-3 | `sc-agent-http` shared HTTP crate | L |
| D12 (sc-treesitter), RBQA-F006 (producer caller) | r-3c | sc-treesitter clap + git helper | M |
| D3 (engine + backend digest) | r-2b | multi-backend semantics | L |
| D2 (compose), D7 (workspace-tests), D12 (sc-ai), D3 (consumers) | r-3b | composition crate, workspace tests, consumers | XL |
| Owner decisions 2026-11-07 (items 1–3, 5, 6, 7) | r-7 | `sc-decision-schema` crate and model catalog | XL |
| D9, `jev::v1` | r-5 | Jev wire body as the documented API (all question types) | L |
| Owner decisions 2026-11-07 (items 5, 6, 8, 9) | r-6 | session log wiring | L |

Post-MVP (not scheduled here): decider crates, then laya; kev unscheduled
(owner decision 12).

Sizes: M = 2–3 dev-days, L = 4–5, XL = 6–8. r-1 and r-3b are XL by honest
count (r-1 touches every crate's call sites and tests, both `main.rs` and the
`sc-treesitter` error sites; r-3b creates two crates, migrates two consumers,
ports a parser and adds the CI gates and source scans). Neither splits along
a boundary without re-creating the same-file conflicts this revision removes.
r-2b is L (re-rated in round 2, CPR-M104): beyond the run loop it adds the
`test-util` `WireFault` hook and real-wire-builder digest tests in both
backend crates and the scripted-backend digest.

### Wave table

| Track | Wave | Sprint | `closure_type` | `target_boundary` | `must_follow` | `parallel_safe` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| foundation | 1 | r-1 | contract | agent-types | a-10 | [r-4] |
| release | 1 | r-4 | contract | release | a-10 | [r-1] |
| runtime | 2 | r-2 | boundary | jev-check | r-1 | [r-3, r-3c] |
| http | 2 | r-3 | boundary | agent-http | r-1 | [r-2, r-3c] |
| producer | 2 | r-3c | boundary | treesitter | r-1, r-4 | [r-2, r-3] |
| runtime | 3 | r-2b | boundary | jev-check | r-2, r-3 | [] |
| integration | 4 | r-3b | integration | jev-host | r-2b, r-3, r-3c | [] |
| schema | 5 | r-7 | contract | decision-schema | r-3b | [] |
| jev | 6 | r-5 | boundary | jev | r-7, r-2b | [r-6] |
| observability | 6 | r-6 | contract | session-log | r-7 | [r-5] |

**Critical path:** r-1 → r-2 → r-2b → r-3b → r-7 → r-6 = **6 sprints**
(r-5 runs beside r-6 in wave 6, so it does not lengthen the path).
**Width:** 3 (wave 2). **Sprint count:** 10.
**Effort:** r-1 XL + r-4 M + r-2 L + r-3 L + r-3c M + r-2b L + r-3b XL +
r-7 XL + r-5 L + r-6 L ≈ 42–55 dev-days in total; the critical path
(XL + L + L + XL + XL + L) is ≈ 30–39 dev-days.

**Why r-7 runs alone in wave 5 and r-5/r-6 share wave 6.** r-7 moves the
decision types and touches every crate's imports, so it cannot run beside
any sprint that edits those files. r-5 and r-6 are `parallel_safe` with
disjoint files: r-5 owns `crates/sc-jev/**`, `sc-jev-backends`
`validate.rs`/`wire.rs`, and `sc-decision-schema` `payload.rs`, `jev/**`
and their tests and fixtures; r-6 owns `sc-agent-http` `retry.rs`, the
`sc-agent-types` ids/observability/git paths, `sc-decision-schema`
`test_util.rs` (`with_sent_body` only) and the engine, compose and consumer
logging paths. r-7 lands the request-trace hand-off and `fn model_id` in
`sc-jev` and `sc-jev-backends` first, so r-6 edits no backend file and does
not depend on r-5's body change: `sc-agent-http` hashes whatever body is
sent.

**Why r-3b follows r-2b.** r-3b is the integration
sprint of the runtime track: the CLI's partial-failure output (exit 2, stdout
envelope, stderr first failure), `--chain-context`, the Python `chain_context`
kwarg and `JevError.response` are feature-level behaviour that passes through
r-2b's run loop. r-2b cannot be hoisted into r-2 (it rewrites the loop r-2
creates) or run beside r-2 (it needs r-3's final-body send path to recover
`input_sha256`). Running r-3b beside r-2b was round-1 defect CPR-003. Wave 3
runs one sprint; r-3c moved to wave 2 to keep usable width at 3.

**Why r-4 runs in wave 1 beside r-1.** r-4 is ADR text plus manifests: root
`[workspace.dependencies]`, the `cli` feature with optional mimalloc and clap
on the two binary crates' `Cargo.toml`, and the CI feature matrix. It edits no
`main.rs`: `[[bin]] required-features = ["cli"]` means the binary target is
compiled only when `cli` (and so `dep:mimalloc`) is on, so the existing
unconditional `#[global_allocator]` line stays valid. Both `main.rs` files
belong to r-1 in wave 1 (error-variant migration). The one shared file is
root `Cargo.toml`, split by line (r-1 deletes the `sc-observability-types`
line; r-4 owns the rest) and ordered by the wave-1 merge rule (r-1 first).

### Must-follow artifacts

| Edge | Artifact consumed |
| --- | --- |
| r-2 → r-1 | `BackendDescriptor` + `BACKENDS`, `BackendSet`, backend factory table + `registry::tests::test_every_backend_has_factory`, `JevError::ProducerError` + `from_error_response`, `ErrorCode`, `RepoRelativePath`, `ScAgentErrorResponse` field rule, `QuestionAnswer` with `confidence`, `PayloadBundle::question_ids()`, `git::{discover_toplevel, read_at_rev}`, `CancelToken`, `with_default_transport` constructors, `test_util::MockJudgeBackend` (full contract), `ScriptedJudge`/`RequestLog` gone, `sc-jev-check` `test-util = ["sc-agent-types/test-util"]`, D0 spike result in `boundaries/README.md` |
| r-3 → r-1 | `NetworkErrorKind`, `retryable()`, `CancelToken` (always-on core) + `JudgeRequest::cancel`, `ResolvedApiKey` (`Arc<str>`, no `new`), no `#[allow]` left in the files r-3 deletes or moves, D0 spike result (self edge of `sc-agent-http`) |

| r-3c → r-4 | `cli` feature and optional `clap` in `crates/sc-treesitter/Cargo.toml` |

| r-2b → r-1 | `MockJudgeBackend::{with_reported_digest, with_failure, refusing, validations}` |
| r-2b → r-3 | final serialized `HttpRequest.body` in both backend crates (digest recovery point); `send_with_busy_retry` no-resend rule; `JevClient` left in `sc-jev/src/client/mod.rs`; `test_util::{RecordingTransport, ScriptedTransport}` (r-2b D6 transports) |

| r-3b → r-2b | `BackendStatus::Failed` produced at runtime, `ChainContext` honoured, the scripted-answers schema (shared and per-backend forms) |
| r-3b → r-3 | `sc-agent-http` in the consumer input publish order |
| r-3b → r-3c | `sc-treesitter` `cli` binary with clap and `--version` (driven by `e2e_treesitter_producer`) |
| r-5 → r-2b, r-3, r-3b | `input_sha256` recovery, `sc-jev` as wire-format crate, `workspace-tests --test jev_cross_impl` |
| r-7 → r-2b, r-3, r-3b | final run loop and `JudgeOutcome` shape (r-2b), `sc-agent-http` `HttpRequest` + consumer input order (r-3), `sc-jev-host`, `workspace-tests`, rendered release files (r-3b) |
| r-5 → r-7 | `CanonicalJudgePayload` in `sc-decision-schema/src/payload.rs`, `DecisionAnswers`, `ModelId`, `DecisionSchemaId` versioning rule, the request-trace and `fn model_id` lines in `sc-jev` that r-5 keeps |
| r-6 → r-7 | `SessionLogRow` + `RowContext` + `SESSION_LOG_DDL` + `COLUMNS`, `ModelId` / `ModelAliases`, `JudgeBackend::model_id`, `SendTrace` passed per send to `JudgeBackend::judge` + the required `SendTrace` parameter of `send_with_busy_retry` / `send_and_parse` with the backend hand-offs, `ProjectLabel`, `JudgeBackend` and `MockJudgeBackend` in `sc-decision-schema`, `DecisionSchemaId::CURRENT` |

## REQ closure (one owning sprint per `req:` root)

| Sprint | `req:` roots closed |

Amendments to existing rows (each lands once): REQ-SAG-0101, REQ-SAG-0103,
REQ-SAG-0120, REQ-SAG-0121, REQ-SAG-0701, NFR-SAG-0001 (r-1); REQ-SAG-0601,
REQ-SAG-0710 (r-2); REQ-SAG-0505 (r-3); REQ-SAG-0130 (r-3 bullet for
`sc-agent-http`, r-3b bullet for `sc-jev-host`); REQ-SAG-0711 (r-3b,
root and `docs/sc-ai/requirements.md`); REQ-SAG-0103, REQ-SAG-0107 and
REQ-SAG-0130 (r-7 bullet for `sc-decision-schema`; root and
`docs/sc-agent-types/requirements.md`); REQ-SAG-0600 and REQ-SAG-0611 (r-6;
root and `docs/sc-jev-check/requirements.md`). The crate-level rows of
REQ-SAG-0101, 0103, 0120, 0121 and NFR-SAG-0001
(`docs/sc-agent-types/requirements.md`) carry the same `(Proposed, r-1)`
amendment; the crate-level REQ-SAG-0701 row in `docs/sc-ai/requirements.md`
is updated by r-3b, which owns that file. Every amended row has a `req:`
acceptance row with a command and expected result in its landing sprint. Every id a sprint's files touch is in its `requirements:` list; ids
that are not `req:` roots there are regressions, each with a named command in
that sprint's `boundary:` row.
r-3c closes no `req:` root (boundary-rooted; it contributes to REQ-SAG-0712
and REQ-SAG-0135, which r-3b closes). Existing rows not listed are regression
`boundary:` rows only.

## Owner decisions 2026-11-07 (decision schema r-7, session log wiring r-6)

Source: `.cursor/phase-a-orchestration.json` key `owner_decisions_2026_11_07`.

1. **`sc-decision-schema`** (new, published, data-only: serde types,
   versions, DDL; no HTTP/git/logging dependency) holds the versioned
   decision schema (today's `CanonicalJudgePayload`, `Question`, `ChoiceId`,
   `QuestionAnswer`, `JudgeOutcome` and friends), one serde request/response
   struct per Jev API call (D9 direction: no byte-splice), Haiku/Luna I/O on
   the same schema, per-model-family schema variants for future local
   decision models, and the session-log SQLite DDL with its `fields{}`
   projection. Sprint r-7, ADR-SAG-0030 and ADR-SAG-0031 "Storage schema";
   the Jev structs (`jev::v1`) land in r-5 with the body they serialize.
2. **Layering.** `sc-agent-types` is below `sc-decision-schema` and holds the
   types every agent kind shares; the decision types move (not copy) so each
   has one home. `sc-agent-types` keeps ids, errors, secrets, git, cancel,
   the observability port and the catalogs.
3. **Model catalog** in `sc-agent-types`: open `ModelId` enum (known variants
   plus a string fallback), `latest(alias)` from an in-crate table,
   overridable by config (`check.toml` `[models]`). `BackendId` = how we
   call; `ModelId` = which model; the log's `model_id` is the `ModelId`.
4. **Long-term scope (recorded, not built):** decision models, Claude/Codex
   via SDK/API, and CLI agents (claude-code, codex-cli, cursor-cli, …)
   through a wrapper; more agent kinds land in `sc-agent-types` over time.
   No conflict (owner, 2026-11-07): REQ-SAG-0900/0901 define the
   API-direct agents; CLI wrappers are additional future agent kinds.
5. **Log line shape:** the row lives inside the sc-observability v2
   `fields{}` object (ADR-SAG-0013's no-bespoke-writer rule stays); the
   row's outcome key is `send_outcome`; the SQLite schema is authoritative
   and the JSONL projection is one line's `fields{}`; a loader reads it into
   the tables. This supersedes the earlier "flat top-level, no nesting"
   wording.
6. **Send trace:** `sc-agent-http` hashes the request body at the send site
   (one place for Jev, Haiku and Luna) and records `request_sha256` for the
   engine; `model_id` comes from a provided `JudgeBackend` method that
   backends override with their configured model. A failed send logs
   `model_id` always and `request_sha256` NULL when no body was built. r-6
   no longer depends on r-5's body change.
7. **Schema version placement:** outside the hashed canonical bytes (in the
   sc-agent-owned wrappers: the log row and the session document), so
   `prompt_sha256` and the Python cross-implementation fixture stay
   byte-identical.
8. Previously decided (r-6): ULID session ids; `request_sha256` = SHA-256 of
   exactly what is sent, the future cache key; `repo` = main repository
   (a worktree resolves to it), else the calling folder; `project` = free
   caller text; context on every line; `sc-sha` for SHA-256; JSONL for the
   MVP, SQLite soon. D9 direction confirmed: one typed serde struct per Jev
   API call.
9. **Log-write failure policy:** keep today's best-effort log write, so a
   rejected or failed log row never fails the run (a logger flush failure
   stays a `data.warnings` entry). Parent's decision under the owner's
   ceremony guidance of 2026-11-07; r-6 pins it with
   `test_rejected_log_row_keeps_run_ok`.

10. **D9 resolved** (owner, 2026-11-07): the TypeSafe Jev API as documented
    in `.claude/skills/plan-anchoring/references/jev-api.md` is the source
    of truth; sc-agent supports every documented question format, with the
    schemas in `sc_decision_schema::jev::v1` (see "(c)" below and r-5).
11. **sc-sha** (owner, from the sc-sha 1.7.0 source): the API is
    `calculate_hash(HashInput::TextFileBytes { utf8_file_bytes })`, which
    takes strict UTF-8, normalizes CRLF and bare CR to LF and returns
    `TemplateSha256`; there is no raw-bytes API. serde_json compact output
    has no raw CR and request bodies are UTF-8 text, so for request bodies
    the digest equals SHA-256 of the sent bytes (query text is identified in
    its LF-normalized form). `sc-sha` depends on `sha2`, so `sha2` appears only
    transitively (the `--depth 1` checks allow it).
12. **Crate naming and post-MVP roadmap** (owner, 2026-11-07, recorded, not
    built): `sc-jev-*` is the Jev decision family (Jev API requests or
    Jev-schema questions; Haiku/Luna answer Jev-schema questions over their
    own provider HTTP) and consumers built only on it, such as
    `sc-jev-py`; other decision APIs get their own `sc-decider*`, `sc-laya*`,
    `sc-kev*` crates; `sc-decision-*` is the API-agnostic layer, which also
    hosts one versioned module per API (`jev::v1` from r-5). Post-MVP order: decider crates first, then laya; kev
    unscheduled. See `docs/architecture.md` "Crate naming convention".

No owner questions remain open.

| ADR-SAG-0028 (new) | `workspace-tests` crate: purpose, dev-only edges, built-binary contract, forbidden edges | r-3b |
| ADR-SAG-0030 (new) | decision schema crate and model catalog (whole ADR except the "Jev API structs" bullet, r-5; the "Scope context" bullet stays recorded, owner-gated); amends 0005, 0009, 0012 (r-5), 0016, 0017, 0019, 0022, 0026, 0027 | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0031 (new) | "Storage schema" subsection: SQLite DDL, `fields{}` projection, nullability, content rule | r-7 |

| ADR-SAG-0005 | `PayloadBundle`/`JudgeRequest` are `sc-decision-schema` types | r-7 |

| ADR-SAG-0012 | Jev wire types are data in `sc-decision-schema::jev`; `sc-jev` still owns every operation | r-5 |
| ADR-SAG-0013 | the row lives in the v2 `fields{}` object; `send_outcome` | r-6 |
| ADR-SAG-0016 | port stays; record types and DDL in `sc-decision-schema` | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0016 | `LogEvent` carries the row's fields | r-6 |
| ADR-SAG-0017 | published library set + publish order: `sc-decision-schema` (order 2) | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0019 | Haiku/Luna output is `DecisionAnswers` | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0022 | `MockJudgeBackend` moves to `sc_decision_schema::test_util` | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0026 | compose-half type note: `JudgeOutcome` owner; HTTP half: the exchange fns take a required `SendTrace` | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0026 | HTTP half records the request digest; compose passes `repo`/`project` | r-6 |
| ADR-SAG-0027 | layering, `judge`/`test-util` features deleted, checklist gains the model rows, core gains `SendTrace` and `ProjectLabel` | r-7 |
| ADR-SAG-0027 | core dependencies `ulid`, `sc-sha`; `LogEvent` surface change | r-6 |

ADR-SAG-0026 has an ADR-level **Status** line ("Proposed — HTTP half lands in
r-3, host half in r-3b"); r-3 sets it to "Active (HTTP half, r-3); compose
half Proposed (r-3b)" and r-3b to "Active". ADR-SAG-0025 likewise: r-2b
sets it to "Active (Phase A.1, r-2b); the REQ-SAG-0604 consumer-output
bullet is Proposed (r-3b)" and r-3b to "Active". The ADR index rows for
ADR-SAG-0023..0028 are written by this plan PR (conventions). Plan review 4
made two exceptions to "never adds or removes an entry": r-3 adds the
ADR-SAG-0020 "A.1 subsection (Proposed, r-3b)" marker when it moves the
`source_scans` clause out, and r-2b splits ADR-SAG-0025 bullet 2; both are
written out verbatim in the sprint docs. The ADR-SAG-0002 r-5 amendment
follows the plan-time convention (inserted Proposed by this plan PR).
ADR-SAG-0030 and ADR-SAG-0031 follow the plan-time
convention with no exception: this plan PR (round 6) inserts both as
Proposed, with their index rows and every Amended-by marker and amendment
subsection; r-7 and r-6 only flip their own. The r-1 interim rows above are already marked in the
index ("A.1 subsection (Active, r-1)" in rows 0008, 0014, 0019); the
sentence-level supersession is written by r-2b, which owns the interim
Status lines of 0008 and 0019 for that purpose.

**No shape on another sprint's Proposed text.** A sprint may not ship a
code shape whose only governing text is another sprint's Proposed
amendment; it must land an Active interim amendment of its own (as r-1 did
for ADR-SAG-0008/0014/0019) or defer the shape to the sprint that owns the
amendment (as r-2 defers `RunConfig::mode` to r-2b).

**ADR-SAG-0029** (a-10, PR 20; Active when PR 20 merges) amends ADR-SAG-0020
(a) and ADR-SAG-0022 (b). A.1 does not reuse the id and does not restate
0029: each A.1 amendment that replaces a 0029 sentence names it ("supersedes
the ADR-SAG-0029 (a) sentence …"), as listed in the table above, and the
0029 index row carries those markers. Sentences of 0029 that A.1 relies on
unchanged: `sc-agent-secrets` has no Cargo features; `try_new` is the one
construction rule set; `clippy.toml` lists `ResolvedApiKey::as_str`;
`sc_jev_py.run_check` has one signature; `_testing.run_check_scripted` is
the Python scripted seam; the string shorthand is normalised inside
`register_scripted_backends`.

`docs/sc-agent-types/architecture.md` and REQ-SAG-0103: r-1 is the one
deliberate unfreeze of the a-1 frozen contract; the doc states "re-frozen at
r-1 merge". `docs/sc-jev-py/architecture.md`, section "Contract": the
`build_request` sentence is owned by r-2; its compose and `chain_context`
sentences by r-3b (anchored by section because a-10 rewrites that section).
ADR-SAG-0012 is unchanged: `sc-jev` still owns every Jev API operation and
`sc-agent-http` only carries bytes (stated in ADR-SAG-0026). ADR-SAG-0021
per-root path precedence is unchanged (r-3b acceptance proves it).

## Underspecified decisions and owner confirmations

### Owner decisions

**(a) Publishing `sc-jev-host` — DECIDED (owner, 2026-11-06).**
`sc-jev-host` is published to crates.io as an internal-support crate,
`=`-pinned from `sc-ai` and `sc-jev-py`, with no semver promise of its own.
This amends D2's word "unpublished": `sc-ai` is published and cannot depend on
an unpublished crate. Consequences, all owned by r-3b: the ADR-SAG-0026
host half, the ADR-SAG-0023 pin list (compose pin effective when the crate
lands), the ADR-SAG-0017 published-crate set, the ADR-SAG-0016 amendment
(supersedes "do not publish a separate observability crate" for this crate),
consumer input `publish_order` directly after `sc-jev-check`, and the
REQ-SAG-0130 amendment. (REQ-QA-002, CPR-019.)

**(b) Busy-retry numbers — DECIDED (owner, 2026-11-06; `PHASE-A-REVIEW.md`
"Owner confirmation (2026-11-06, retry policy)").** (CPR-M7, OBS-F,
REQ-SAG-0505.) Encoded by r-3 in `BusyPolicy::default()`; ADR-SAG-0007 r-3
amendment and the REQ-SAG-0505 amendment record it.
> Later change: owner decision of 2026-11-08 set busy retry to 5 sends with
> waits of 1, 2, 4, 8 s. See the ADR-SAG-0007 phase-end amendment and
> REQ-SAG-0505 amendment. The 4-send text here describes what r-3 shipped.

- Statuses 429/502/529 only; at most 4 sends at r-3 (5 since the phase-end
  amendment).
- A valid Retry-After is honoured, clamped 0–30 s. Valid means at most 32
  bytes of ASCII digits with an optional `.` and ASCII-digit fraction
  (`^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$`); anything else (HTTP-date, sign, exponent, `inf`,
  `NaN`, empty) is malformed. Absent **or malformed** Retry-After (malformed
  is treated like missing, not 30 s): exponential backoff from about 1 s —
  1, 2, 4, 8 … capped at 30 s. With at most 4 sends at r-3 there are at most three
  waits, so the r-3 default sequence is 1, 2, 4 s (1, 2, 4, 8 s since the
  phase-end amendment); 8 s and the 30 s cap apply only
  to a non-default `BusyPolicy` with more sends. Every wait adds up to 250 ms
  jitter.
- 90 s budget from the first send for **starting** new attempts; every wait
  is capped to the remaining budget; an in-flight attempt keeps its 120 s
  request timeout. A cancel is observed before each attempt and within
  100 ms during a wait; a cancel during an in-flight request is observed when
  that request returns, so worst-case cancel latency is the 120 s request
  timeout (stated in rustdoc and ADR-SAG-0007).
- No network-connectivity detection and no indefinite wait on network loss:
  connect/DNS failures return `NETWORK_ERROR` with `retryable() == true`
  immediately, and the caller (CLI, Python, future MCP) decides whether to
  retry. A transport error or timeout after the body was sent is never
  retried.
- This removes round 1's malformed-header exhaustion (CPR-M7): 4 sends (5 since
  the phase-end amendment) fit
  inside the budget unless the server's own Retry-After values exceed it.

**(c) D9 Jev payload shape — resolved (owner, 2026-11-07).** The source of
truth is the TypeSafe Jev API (`POST /v1/systemone`) as documented in
`.claude/skills/plan-anchoring/references/jev-api.md`: a flat body
`{model, state, questions}`; `questions` keyed by question id, each
`{type, instructions}` with `type` `choice` (criteria map, up to 255
options), `score` (2 to 10 ordered levels) or `noul` (yes-probability, no
confidence); `state` a string, object or array; the reply
`{model, answers{id: {type, choice, probabilities, confidence}}, usage}`.
sc-agent supports every question format, with the schemas in
`sc_decision_schema::jev::v1`. One plan, r-5: today's array payload
`{id, prompt, choices}` maps onto `choice` questions; the canonical
`Question` gains optional `kind` and `descriptions` (additive, so existing
payload bytes, `prompt_sha256` and the cross-impl fixture are unchanged);
the golden `check-request.json` is written from the documented shape.
- **Publish gate (CPR-014):** no crate is published to crates.io until r-5
  lands. `cargo publish --dry-run` runs throughout; a real publish does not.

### Planner resolutions (stand unless the owner objects)

1. **Byte cap owner (D13, REQ-QA-011):** each backend, through
   `BackendDescriptor::request_limit_bytes` read by its own
   `validate_for_send`. Alternative not taken: one engine cap. Dry-run reports
   `payload_bytes` and `over_limit` per selected backend (REQ-SAG-0314).
2. **Old entry points deleted with no shims** (nothing published).
3. **Python `run_check` keeps its Python name** and calls `prepare` + `run`.
4. **Serde spelling `openai_luna` / `openai`** with a one-release read alias
   (bead `agt-backend-serde-alias-removal`) for config and caller-request
   input. The alias is not a session-file compatibility path (see 7).
5. **No new stable error codes**; new variants map to existing ids (code
   table in r-1).
6. **`Error::source()` is `None`** for redacted-cause variants by design.
7. **Phase A session files are not readable after r-1:** session document
   version 2; a version-1 file is `SESSION_DOCUMENT_INVALID` with "re-run the
   check" recovery.
8. **Repo root is the git toplevel** for both consumers (ADR-SAG-0003
   amendment); outside git it is `start`, absolutized. `sc-jev-py` called from
   a subdirectory now reads the toplevel `.env`.
9. **Session written once**, at the end of `run`, only when a backend with
   `supports_session_ask` returned `Ok`.
10. **tree-sitter and grammar pins stay exact** (output determinism).
11. **`InputSpec` moves to `sc-jev-check::config`** in r-1, unchanged; r-2
    adds `Command.path`. No second consumer crate exists (RBQA Q4).
12. **Shared git read lives in `sc-agent-types::git`** behind the
    **non-default** `git` feature (std-only, no new dependency): both callers
    already depend on `sc-agent-types`, which owns `Rev`, `RepoRoot`,
    `RepoRelativePath` and `BlobSha`; `sc-treesitter` may not depend on
    `sc-jev-check`; a separate `sc-agent-git` crate would be a fourth new
    crate for about 150 lines. Only `sc-jev-check` (normal dependency) and
    `sc-treesitter`'s `cli` feature enable it, so `sc-jev`, `sc-jev-backends`,
    `sc-agent-secrets`, `sc-agent-http`, `sc-ai` and `sc-jev-py` do not link
    process-spawning code through their own feature requests (feature
    unification in a workspace build can still compile it; the isolated
    per-library `cargo build -p <lib>` CI rows prove the seam). The
    `sc-treesitter` library stays I/O-free. From r-3b, `clippy.toml`
    `disallowed-methods` lists `std::process::Command::new`, so any process
    spawn outside an `#[expect]` site fails `cargo clippy --all-targets`, and
    `workspace-tests --test source_scans`
    (`test_disallowed_methods_expect_sites`) allows production expect sites
    only in `sc-agent-types/src/git.rs` and the `command` extractor's
    user-argv spawn in `sc-jev-check/src/extract/command.rs`, plus the
    `#[cfg(test)]` `test_support::git_command` fixture helper in
    `sc-jev-check/src/extract/mod.rs` (RBQA-F102, CPR-301). All those expect
    lines land in r-3b with the `clippy.toml` entry (an expect with nothing
    to fulfil fails `-D warnings`), after a pre-merge
    `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` sweep whose
    fixed sites the PR lists.

Round-2 resolutions in the same standing: module seams are cargo features
(`judge`, `secret`, `obs` default-on; `git` and `test-util` non-default;
`cancel` is always-on core; `sc-treesitter` uses `default-features = false`);
partial failure exits 2; `JudgeBackend` stays open with future methods
defaulted; per-question answers use a new `QuestionAnswer` type rather than
`ChoiceAnswer`, which is part of the canonical `state` bytes.

The allow-attribute check is `source_scans` (`test_no_allow_attributes`);
the phase run has no separate `rg` gate.

After all ten sprints merge (r-1, r-4, r-2, r-3, r-3c, r-2b, r-3b, r-7, r-5,
r-6), the phase run adds the "Required validation" blocks of r-7, r-5 and r-6, and every `cargo publish --dry-run` line lists `-p sc-decision-schema`
second.

Expected: all exit 0, and `.github/workflows/sc-agent-ci.yml` is green on
ubuntu, macos and windows. Then re-run the phase-ending six-reviewer gate. No
real crates.io publish (gate (c)).

## Findings closure (one owning sprint per id)

Every id the Phase A review classified architectural (the 19 phase-end
architectural ids plus every deep-review `architectural_refinement` or
owner-decision id), and the routine ids A.1 also touches. "Owner" closes the
id; other sprints may contribute but do not claim it. Ids collide across
reviews: `RBP-F001 (phase-end)` is the error-prefix finding; `RBP-F001 (a-9)`
is the a-9 pin finding, the same defect as `ARCH-001 (phase-end)`. Plan-review
round-1 ids are dispositioned in `plan-review-1-dispositions.md`.

| ARCHC-010 | r-1 | one `JudgeBackend` test double home: `sc_agent_types::test_util::MockJudgeBackend` (`test-util` feature), which records requests and validations, reports `input_sha256`, and can fail at `judge` or refuse at `validate_for_send`; `ScriptedJudge`/`RequestLog` deleted; the scripted registry stays a registry builder over it (ADR-SAG-0022 r-1 amendment) |

| RBQA-F010 | r-1 | typed answers, `commands` removed, `PayloadBundle::encode` |

### This phase does not close

- **ARCHC-006** (blocking `JudgeBackend`, prepare/send split): D10 keeps the
  sync trait and defers the split to the first Phase B agent that needs
  async. A.1 adds the `# Blocking` rustdoc and `CancelToken`.
- **ARCHP-009** (one file per producer call, `Parser`/`Query` rebuilt per
  call, no match limit): producer throughput with no A.1 consumer; the Phase B
  multi-file producer owns it. Bead `agt-treesitter-multifile`.
- **D9** (r-5): resolved and landed in r-5; the `"model"` byte-splice is deleted.
- Phase B features: API-direct agents (REQ-SAG-0900/0901), MCP server (a third
  thin adapter over `sc-jev-host`), typed `JudgeMeta`, a second session
  store, a crate split of `sc-agent-types` (module paths are the stable surface
  for a later re-export split, ADR-SAG-0027).
- `agt-luna-live-count` (Luna live `equal`), still open from Phase A.
- New stable error codes in `errors.json`. *(Superseded in part: bead `agt-2a3`, outside the r-sprints, owns the error-contract amendments before the first release: the ids `AUTH_FAILED`, `API_REQUEST_INVALID`, `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`, `PROVIDER_BUSY`, `API_ERROR` and `IO_FAILED`, the amended REQ-SAG-0101, 0106, 0505, 0604 and 0701, NFR-SAG-0001 and NFR-SAG-0002, and the new REQ-SAG-0160..0166, per the ADR-SAG-0026, 0027 and 0020 `agt-2a3` amendments in `docs/architecture.md`. No sprint doc.)*
- `agt-obs-v2-shim-removal`: removal keeps `LogRejected`/`SessionLog` as the
  port; only the compose adapter changes.
