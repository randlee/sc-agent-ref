# sc-agent-http — architecture

**Boundary:** `agent-http` (`boundaries/sc-agent-http/agent-http.toml`)
**Depends on:** `sc-agent-types` (`default-features = false`,
`features = ["secret"]`), `ureq`
**Dependents:** `sc-jev`, `sc-jev-backends`
**Governing ADRs:** ADR-SAG-0026 (HTTP half), ADR-SAG-0006 / 0007 / 0017 /
0020 r-3 amendments, ADR-SAG-0012 (unchanged: `sc-jev` owns every Jev API
operation; this crate only carries bytes).

## Modules

All modules are private; the crate root re-exports the public items, plus the
`test_util` module under `test-util`.

| Module | Public items | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request` | `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`, `Method`, `HeaderName`, `SecretHeader`, `Endpoint` | Values with private fields, constructors and accessors. `HttpRequest::new(method, endpoint, body: Arc<[u8]>)`, `with_header`, `with_secret`; `HttpResponse::new(status, headers, body)`, `status`, `header` (case-insensitive), `body`, `into_body`. `HeaderName` is a `&'static str` RFC 9110 token (`const fn new`). `Endpoint::parse` accepts only `https://` URLs |
| `transport` | `Transport`, `Timeouts` | The open transport trait; connect and request deadlines (10 s / 120 s default) |
| `ureq_transport` | `UreqTransport` | The production transport and the single secret read site |
| `retry` | `BusyPolicy`, `BusyExhaustion`, `send_with_busy_retry`, `send_and_parse`, `HttpClient` | Busy retry with the decided numbers and the cancel hook; the one exchange (send, retry, parse, redact) and the transport + policy + token state every backend holds |
| `redact` | `redact` | Removes the request's secret from every text field of an error |
| `test_util` (`test-util`) | `FakeClock`, `RecordingSleeper`, `ScriptedTransport`, `RecordingTransport` | Doubles for this crate's and the backend crates' tests |

## `Transport` contract

`Transport::send(&self, &HttpRequest) -> Result<HttpResponse, JevError>` sends
once. Every HTTP status is `Ok`; connection, send, read and timeout failures
are `NETWORK_ERROR` with a `NetworkErrorKind`; a body over the cap is
`RESPONSE_INVALID`. The trait is open (ADR-SAG-0006) and object-safe, with
blanket impls for `&T` and `Arc<T>`. A direct `send` caller bypasses busy
retry **and** redaction; production code calls only `send_and_parse` (which wraps `send_with_busy_retry`).
A transport other than `UreqTransport` cannot read the key: it sees
`SecretHeader::name` and `redacted` only, plus, under `test-util`, the
`matches` equality oracle for test transports.

`UreqTransport::new(Timeouts)` builds one ureq agent from one private
`AgentConfig` value (connect timeout, global request timeout covering the
body read, `max_redirects = 0`, https only, `User-Agent: sc-agent-http/<ver>`,
statuses not errors) and reuses it for every send and every clone. The body
is read through a `take(8 MiB + 1)` reader, so the cap holds while streaming
and for error statuses. No ureq type is in any public signature; URL
validation uses ureq's re-exported `http::Uri` inside the private module.

## Secret read site (ADR-SAG-0020 r-3)

A credential travels only as a `SecretHeader` (`new(name, key)` or
`bearer(key)`) inside `HttpRequest`. `ureq_transport::expose` is the one call
of `ResolvedApiKey::as_str` in the workspace and carries
`#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "single secret read site (ADR-SAG-0020)")]`;
`SecretHeader::matches` (`test-util` only) is implemented in the same file
through it. Root
`Cargo.toml` denies `allow_attributes` and `allow_attributes_without_reason`,
so a second site needs a visible `#[expect]`. This is a lint-enforced
workspace convention, not a type seal: crates outside the workspace are not
constrained.

## Redaction rule

Backends call `send_and_parse(transport, &request, &policy, &cancel, parse)`
(or `HttpClient::send_and_parse(&request, parse)`), which runs
`send_with_busy_retry` and then `parse(response)`, and redacts `parse`'s
error against the same request (RBP-F007). The backend's non-200 mapping and
reply parser live inside `parse`, so no call site redacts by hand; the
backend adds only its provider label (`Jev …`, `haiku …`) afterwards.

`send_with_busy_retry` passes every `Err` it returns — the busy and cancel
errors it builds and every error a transport returns, third-party transports
included, whatever the variant — through `redact` exactly once.
`redact(error, &request)` uses `ResolvedApiKey::redact_error`, which maps
every text field, so a header echo or body excerpt containing the key becomes
`[redacted]`.

## Busy retry and cancel latency

`BusyPolicy::default()` encodes owner decision (b) (REQ-SAG-0505 amended,
ADR-SAG-0007 r-3): 429/502/529 only; 5 sends; a valid Retry-After clamped to
0–30 s; absent or malformed → 1, 2, 4, 8 s; up to 250 ms
jitter (std `RandomState` hashed with the current time); a 90 s budget from
the first send, every wait `min(wait + jitter, remaining)`, no attempt
starts once it is spent. Exhausting the sends gives detail
"HTTP <s> busy; N sends exhausted"; exhausting the budget gives
"HTTP <s> busy after N sends; retry budget exhausted". Both are
`NETWORK_ERROR` kind `Busy`, `retryable() == true`; `BusyExhaustion::of(&error)`
returns `Sends` or `Budget` from the fixed detail endings
(`BusyExhaustion::SENDS_SUFFIX` / `BUDGET_SUFFIX`), so callers never match on
text themselves.

The `CancelToken` is checked before every attempt and before each wait slice
(≤ 100 ms), so a cancel during a wait returns `Cancelled` within 100 ms. A
cancel during an in-flight request is observed only when the request returns:
the worst-case cancel latency is the request timeout (120 s by default).
Errors are never retried, so a connect or DNS failure returns
`NETWORK_ERROR` kind `Connect` at once and the caller decides; there is no
connectivity probing.

## `test-util` seam

Non-default, additive, enabled only by dev-dependencies and
`--features test-util` (plan "Test seams"; D0 outcome 4: no self
dev-dependency, the `retry` and `ureq` targets declare
`[[test]] required-features = ["test-util"]`). It adds:

- `BusyPolicy::with_test_hooks(FakeClock, RecordingSleeper, jitter)`: a fake
  monotonic clock, a sleeper that records waits and slices and advances the
  clock (optionally cancelling a token after a set time), and a fixed jitter.
  There is no public sleeper trait in a normal build.
- `Endpoint::loopback_http(port, path)`: only `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…`, so
  even a mistaken build cannot send plain HTTP off the machine.
- `UreqTransport::loopback_for_tests(Timeouts)`: the production
  `AgentConfig` with https-only off.
- `test_util::{ScriptedTransport, RecordingTransport}`.

## `SendTrace` parameter (r-7, ADR-SAG-0026 r-7)

`send_with_busy_retry`, `send_and_parse` and `HttpClient::send_and_parse` take
a required `SendTrace` (from `sc-agent-types`), so no backend can send without
one. `HttpRequest`'s body is text (`Arc<str>`, `body() -> &str`); transports
send `body().as_bytes()`. `send_with_busy_retry` records
`Sha256Digest::of_text(request.body())` into the trace once, immediately
before the first `Transport::send` (r-6, REQ-SAG-0613): retries resend the
same bytes, so a send has one value; a cancel before the first attempt
records nothing; headers are not hashed, so no secret is. `trace.rs` pins this
(`--features test-util --test trace`).
