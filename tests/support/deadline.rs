//! Bounded subprocess runner shared by the workspace tests (FTQ-003, FTQ-008,
//! FTQ-011).
//!
//! This is the one copy. Test code includes it with `#[path]`:
//! `sc-ai` and `sc-treesitter` integration tests, `sc-jev-check` unit tests,
//! and the `jev_cross_impl` workspace test. Sharing a dev-support crate is a
//! Phase A.1 decision; a single included file keeps one implementation now.
//!
//! Every wait is bounded:
//!
//! - stdin is written on its own thread, so a child that never reads it
//!   cannot block the runner;
//! - the child must exit within [`SUBPROCESS_DEADLINE`], or it is killed and
//!   the test panics with the stderr captured so far;
//! - stdout and stderr drain on threads that append to shared buffers. After
//!   the child exits (or is killed) the runner waits at most [`PIPE_GRACE`]
//!   for each pipe to close. A pipe still open then is held by a grandchild;
//!   the runner says so on stderr, kills the process group, and returns what
//!   it captured instead of joining the reader thread.
//!
//! On Unix the child leads its own process group and the runner kills the
//! whole group (`kill -KILL -- -<pgid>`), so grandchildren such as a git hook
//! or an `sh -c '... &'` job die with it. Windows kills only the child; the
//! bounded pipe wait still keeps the runner from hanging.
