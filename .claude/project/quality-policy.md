# Repository Quality Policy

Repository-specific QA policy for **sc-agent**. Reusable agents and skills read
this file instead of embedding repo names, commands, or exceptions in prompts.

(Structure follows Synaptic Canvas QA repos; **atm-core** does not ship a
`.claude/project/quality-policy.md` — this file is sc-agent's source of truth.)

## Repository baseline

- Default comparison branch: `develop`
- Requirements index: `docs/requirements.md`
- Architecture index: `docs/architecture.md`
- Product design: `docs/design.md`
- Framework charter: `docs/framework-charter.md`
- Project plan: `docs/project-plan.md`
- Team protocol: `docs/team-protocol.md`
- Cross-platform testing: `docs/cross-platform-guidelines.md`
- Crate docs (when present): `docs/<crate>/requirements.md` and
  `docs/<crate>/architecture.md`
- Developer roster: `docs/development/developer-roster.md`
- Lead session skill: `.claude/skills/team-lead/SKILL.md`

## ATM team (sc-ai)

- Team name: `sc-ai` (see `.atm.toml`, `ATM_TEAM=sc-ai`)
- **Lead identity:** `ai-lead` — orchestration templates use `--var lead=ai-lead`
  (or `"lead": "ai-lead"` in vars JSON)
- **QA enforcer identity:** `ai-qa` — dispatches use member `ai-qa`; prompt file
  remains `.claude/agents/quality-mgr.md`
- **Developers:** `tai`, `lai`, `sai` (Codex)
- Session init: lead runs `/team-lead` at fresh session start

## Reviewer policy

- Initial implementation review: `req-qa`, `arch-qa`, `extensibility-qa`,
  `ruthless-boundary-qa`, `rust-qa-agent`, `rust-best-practices-agent`, and
  `rust-service-hardening-agent`
- Fix verification: `req-qa`, `arch-qa`, and `rust-qa-agent`; dispatch an
  additional reviewer only when rechecking a carry-forward finding it owns
- Plan review QA-1: `req-qa`, `arch-qa`, `extensibility-qa`,
  `ruthless-boundary-qa`, `rust-best-practices-agent`,
  `rust-service-hardening-agent`, and `ceremony-qa`
- Plan review QA-2 and later: `req-qa` and `arch-qa` scoped to dispatched
  findings; dispatch another reviewer only when rechecking a carry-forward
  finding it owns. Plan QA is capped at **3 rounds** (`plan_qa_cycle_limit`);
  a round that leaves only minor findings reports
  `PASS — minor fixes required, no re-QA`
- `ceremony-finding-screen`: every sprint or plan QA round that has findings,
  before the report is posted
- Phase-end review: initial implementation set plus `flaky-test-qa`
- Run `flaky-test-qa` earlier when tests changed or instability is suspected
- `schema-reviewer`: only when Governed Interfaces below names a relevant
  interface; otherwise `SKIPPED`
- Every QA round requires an open PR; the rendered report is posted every round

## Validation policy

Until a Rust workspace exists on `develop`, sprint validation is **docs and agent
asset review only** (no `cargo` gate).

When root `Cargo.toml` exists:

- Sprint QA: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace`
- Phase-end artifact command: same unless a phase plan overrides it

## Release and publishing

- Manifest: `release/publish-artifacts.toml` (minimal until crates/channels ship)
- Channel contracts: `release/publish-channel-contracts.toml`
- Helpers: `.github/scripts/release_artifacts.py`, `worker_result.py`,
  `bootstrap_sc_compose.py`
- Workflows under `.github/workflows/` are kit-aligned (crates.io, PyPI, Homebrew,
  Scoop, WinGet); do not publish until sc-publish consumer input is installed and
  Release Preflight passes

## Repository layout (reviewer expectations)

Reviewers read this table before treating missing paths as Blocking.

| Path | When required |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/architecture.md` | Every review |
| `docs/design.md`, `docs/framework-charter.md` | Plan and architectural review |
| `docs/project-plan.md` | When a phase is active |
| `docs/plans/phase-<phase>/` | Plan and sprint reviews for that phase |
| `docs/<crate>/requirements.md`, `docs/<crate>/architecture.md` | Sprint owns or references that crate |
| `crates/<crate>/` or root `Cargo.toml` | Rust implementation sprints |
| `.claude/project/quality-policy.md` | Every QA round |
| `.claude/assets/sc-rust/` | Rust QA orchestration |
| `.claude/skills/triaging-findings/` | Pre-dispatch finding correlation |
| `.claude/skills/closing-triage/scripts/query_open_findings.py` | Fix rounds when present |

Absent paths marked not yet required are **not** Blocking in bootstrap reviews.

## Governed interfaces

None declared. Until this section names an interface, its compatibility rule,
evidence paths, and approval authority, `schema-reviewer` returns `SKIPPED`.

## Plan naming

Lower case only.

| Thing | Form | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase id | next unused letter(s) | `a` |
| Sprint id | `<phase>-<n>` | `a-1` |
| Plan directory | `docs/plans/phase-<phase>/` | `docs/plans/phase-a/` |
| Phase plan | `plan.md` under `docs/plans/phase-<phase>/` (alias `phase-<phase>-plan.md` also allowed) | `docs/plans/phase-a/plan.md` |
| Sprint doc | `sprint-<phase>-<n>-<slug>.md` | `sprint-a-1-bootstrap.md` |
| Plan branch | `plan/phase-<phase>`, PR to `develop` | `plan/phase-a` |
| Phase branch | `integrate/phase-<phase>`, from `develop` | `integrate/phase-a` |
| Sprint branch | `sprint/<phase>-<n>-<slug>` | `sprint/a-1-bootstrap` |
| Fix layer | `fix/<phase>-<n>-<slug>` | `fix/a-1-qa1` |

Phase plans live only under `docs/plans/phase-<phase>/`.

## Architectural rules

- Agent and skill paths are repo-root-relative; no host-specific paths in
  committed prompts.
- Orchestration dispatches to ATM identities in `.atm.toml` and this policy.

## Repository exceptions

- **Phase A.1 plan naming (`docs/plans/phase-a-refine/`).** Phase id `r`;
  the plan directory is `docs/plans/phase-a-refine/` and the plan branch is
  `plan/phase-a-refine` instead of `docs/plans/phase-r/` / `plan/phase-r`,
  because A.1 refines Phase A rather than opening a new phase and lands on
  `integrate/phase-a`. Sprint ids, sprint docs, sprint branches and beads
  keep the standard form (`r-N`, `sprint-r-N-<slug>.md`,
  `sprint/r-N-<slug>`). `req-qa` and `arch-qa` accept these paths as the
  phase-`r` plan location; no other phase may use a descriptive directory
  name without its own entry here. Recorded by the Phase A.1 plan PR
  (REQ-QA-012, REQ-QA-R2-008).

- **Phase A.1 landing-sprint ADRs (`docs/plans/phase-a-refine/`).** A
  phase-`r` sprint doc may list, in its `adrs` list, an ADR or A.1
  subsection whose Status or marker reads `(Proposed, r-N)` when sprint
  `r-N` is that sprint itself, or a sprint that lands before it in the
  plan's dependency order. This is the convention in `docs/architecture.md`
  (ADR index preamble): the landing sprint flips its own row and markers to
  `(Active, r-N)`. `arch-qa` applies RULE-ADR-PLAN to such ids as follows.
  At plan review, the id resolves and the sprint text matches the
  Proposed design. At sprint QA for `r-N`, the flip is present on the
  sprint branch. Any other dependency on a Proposed ADR stays a finding.
  Recorded by PR 32 (ARCH-006).
